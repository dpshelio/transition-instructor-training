As new members of Software and Data Carpentry's teaching community, this section 
provides some background on both organizations.  

## History 

Software Carpentry has a long history of stops and gos.  Founder Greg Wilson 
identified a need for best practices training in the research computing, and 
after several iterations, the current model of two day workshops with a fairly 
standard curriculum was born in 2011.  

After intermediate support from various organizations, in 2015 
SWC became its own private non-profit, 
the [Software Carpentry Foundation (SCF)](http://software-carpentry.org/scf/).  The 
SCF is now responsible for all aspects of Software Carpentry's operations.

In 2013, members of the Software Carpentry community identified a need in the 
research community for training that was a) aimed at computational novices and 
b) taught researchers how to properly handle their data.  Thus Data Carpentry 
was born, as a separate "sister" organization to Software Carpentry.  

Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry share some aspects of their operations, long-term 
goals, and community structure: 
* both run two-day workshops taught by volunteer instructors
* both target the research community, aiming to fill gaps in current training structures
* both focus on computational skills

Data and Software Carpentry differ in their major content and primary audience: 

* Data Carpentry workshops focus on best practices surrounding data.  The audience 
for a DC workshop is not someone who wants to learn about coding, but rather someone 
who has a lot of data and doesn't know what to do with it.  The DC workshops are: 
	* domain specific
	* a full two-day curriculum - each "domain" workshop has a two-day curriculum 
	that centers around a single data set, so separate domain workshops cannot be 
	mixed and matched.  
	* aimed at pure novices
	
* Software Carpentry workshops focus on best practices surrounding software and 
code development.  The audience for a SWC workshop is someone who has done a little 
bit of programming, or has used computational tools primarily inside a GUI.  The 
SWC workshops are: 
	* not domain specific
	* modular - each Software Carpentry lesson is standalone.  Each workshop must cover 
	at least one lesson each in shell, version control, and a scripting language (python or R)
	to be considered an official SWC workshop (more details below).  There are various 
	additional lessons that can be added to these three base lessons.  
	* aimed at a level slightly above novice, maybe novice+

For more details on the different requirements for running Software and Data Carpentry 
workshops, or being a fully certified Software/Data Carpentry instructor, see below.  

## Workshop Operations

Starting in January 2015 we began running bi-weekly debriefing
sessions for instructors who have recently taught workshops.  In
these, instructors discuss what they actually did, how it worked, how
the lessons they actually delivered differed from our templates, what
problems arose, and so on.

Summaries are posted on our blog shortly after each meeting.
More importantly,
we have condensed this feedback (and much else)
in an [operations guide](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/operations.html)
and a set of checklists
that describes what everyone in a workshop is expected to do and why.

lesson materials, provided that they provide credit for the source material.  In order 
to use our lesson materials in an "official" Software or Data Carpentry workshop, make 
sure to read the website or get in touch with the administrative staff to ensure that 
you are in compliance with the requirements for an official workshop.  

## Getting Certified

To become an official Software or Data Carpentry instructor, potential instructors 
must go through this instructor training and then perform a checkout exercise.  The 
instructor training applies to both Software and Data Carpentry, but independent checkout 
exercises are required to be certified for both organizations.  

## The Carpentry Community 

There are several hubs of activity for the Software and Data Carpentry communities: 

* Github: hosts the content of most lessons.  For Software Carpentry, contributions to 
lessons and discussion of changes happens via GitHub pull requests and issues.  Github 
is also the mechanism for creating landing pages for individual workshops.  
	* [Software Carpentry on GitHub](https://github.com/swcarpentry)
	* [Data Carpentry on GitHub](https://github.com/datacarpentry/)
* Websites: 
	* [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)
		* [Blog](http://software-carpentry.org/blog)
		* [Get involved](http://software-carpentry.org/join/)
	* [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)
		* [Blog](http://www.datacarpentry.org/blog/)
		* [Get involved](http://www.datacarpentry.org/involved/)
* Mailing lists: both Software and Data Carpentry have public "discuss" mailing lists, 
that are host to everything from lively discussion on teaching practices, to job postings, 
to general announcements.  
* Forums: Data Carpentry has a [discussion forum](http://discuss.datacarpentry.org/)
* Twitter:

## Moving Forward

Why did you take this training?  Why do you think it's important to teach these 
workshops?  We would like to know and potential funding agencies would too!  One 
challenge facing the Software and Data Carpentry communities is how to assess our 
impact.  

> ## Feedback on Assessment
>
> Go through the pre-assessment questionnaire given to you by your instructor
> and critique its questions.
> (Remember, critiquing means commenting on positive aspects as well as negative ones.)
> How long do you think it will take the average learner to fill it in?
> How useful do you think the information it gathers will be to you as an instructor?
> How could you improve the questions?
> What would you add, and what would you drop to make room?
{: .challenge}

> ## Assessing Ourselves
>
> We believe that our workshops make researchers more productive.
> If you were a skeptical department chair,
> what would you accept as proof of this?
>
> 1.  Testimonials volunteered by workshop learners are suspect
>     because they are opt-in (people who didn't get anything
>     out of it are less likely to respond than people who did)
>     and because self-assessment is unreliable.
> 2.  Measuring uptake of tools like GitHub is suspect because
>     people might adopt other things instead, and because
>     we would then need to prove that using version control
>     actually makes someone more productive as a researcher
>     (a claim that that is plausible but unproven).
> 3.  Comparing the publication and citation rates of workshop
>     participants (the treatment group) with non-participants
>     (the control group) will take years, and may confuse
>     correlation with causation, since the people who take
>     our workshops might be intrinsically more highly
>     motivated or skilled than those who don't.
>
> Work in small groups to develop and critique other assessments
> that you think would pass the "skeptical chair" test.
