Before we begin discussing "how to teach" in earnest, let's
 start by defining a few terms.

## Educational Psychology

Before we can start talking about how to teach, we need to understand how people learn.  
The field of *educational psychology*, 
studies how people learn.
This touches on everything from the neuropsychology of perception and the mechanisms of memory
to the sociology of school systems
and the philosophical question of what we actually mean by "learning"
(which turns out to be pretty complicated once you start looking beyond
the standardized Western classroom).

Within the broad scope of educational pyschology, 
this training will take a narrow "cognitivist" perspective on education.
We can afford to do this because most of our learners are privileged:
well-fed, physically safe, already well-educated, highly motivated, etc.

## Instructional Design

While what we know about educational psychology can constrain teaching,
it doesn't dictate it.
In particular,
there are often several plausible approaches to teaching
that are consistent with what we know about how brains learn.
In order to decide between them,
we also need to explore *instructional design*,
which is the study of how to create learning materials.
If educational psychology is the science,
ID is the engineering:
it's how our scientific understanding is put into practice on the ground.

For example,
most children today are taught to read using a bottom-up technique called
[phonics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonics),
which introduces them to the sounds of letters,
then puts those letters and their sounds together to make simple words like "bug" and "run",
then assembles the words into sentences and stories.
But another technique called [whole language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_language)
takes a different approach.
Instead of starting with letters,
its proponents teach children to recognize entire words
so that they get the positive feedback of being able to read whole stories as early as possible.
The basic idea is that once children find reading rewarding,
they'll be motivated to go back and figure out the letters.

Both approaches are consistent with what we know about how children learn,
so we need to study them in action to determine which is better.
The findings have been contradictory:
while some studies find that phonics works best,
others show that whole language yields better results.

One explanation is that a third factor is at play.
If children sense that their teachers are enthusiastic about something,
they will respond to that enthusiasm and learn better.
If they feel their teachers are just marking time,
though,
they will emulate that instead.
Thus,
when studies are done by people who are proponents of a new technique
(as they often are),
they are likely to produce positive results,
but when those techniques are deployed more widely
to teachers who have seen one bandwagon after another roll by,
results will regress to the mean.

In this course, we will cover several methods and tools of instructional 
design, exploring their strengths and weaknesses, and trying to connect 
each design to the cognitivist theory that motivates its approach.  

FIXME: ID requires large studies

## Pedagogical Content Knowledge

In the end, effective teaching often depends on what the teacher knows.  
The things teachers know can be divided into:

*   *content knowledge*, such as the "what" of programming;

*   *general pedagogical knowledge*, i.e., an understanding of the
    psychology of learning; and

*   the *pedagogical content knowledge* (PCK) that connects the two,
    which is things like when to teach the notion of a call stack
    and what examples to use when doing so.

This training course focuses on general pedagogical knowledge through the two 
major categories (educational psychology and instructional design) described 
above.  It assumes you know as much as you need to about basic 
programming (our content knowledge).

We *wish* the course could include a lot more material on PCK than it does,
but computing education lags 20-30 years behind fields like mathematics
when it comes to assembling and organizing this kind of knowledge.  Within 
Software Carpentry, we are trying to support the curation of PCK by including 
an instructor's guide with each lesson that describes particular teaching 
techniques for that lesson's content.

## Practicing as We Preach

In the lessons that follow, we have attempted to apply our knowledge of how 
people learn and our recommendations for instructional design, within the format 
of the lessons.
