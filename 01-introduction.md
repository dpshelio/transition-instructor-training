What do (musician), (athlete), (programmer) + teacher have in common?  

All three are examples of *performers* - people who are presenting something 
(music, ideas, emotions, stories) to an audience.  For the purposes of this 
training, we will think of the potential instructor as a beginning performer, 
(an actor, perhaps being the closest parallel).  

To become an accomplished performer, there are many pieces of the process.  There is: 
* Planning: Learning about your discipline, making choices about your approach, 
choosing drills, making a plan to train or practice.  
* Practice: Once we've prepared, it's time to practice based on your plan.  You probably 
won't practice all alone either - there will be friends and colleagues you ask to train 
with you, or review how you're doing.  
* Performance: the final show, concert, game, etc...

This list is linear, but the process of performance tuning is circular - results of 
practice drives preparation, the performance's success or failure impacts practice, etc.  

In this training, we'll be covering
* Planning: learning about how people learn, and some specific tools and techniques 
you can use as you prepare to teach.  
* Practice: actually doing some teaching and "performing", giving feedback to each other 
and discussing how we do things.  
* Performance: This falls outside the scope of this training - teaching at 
your first Software or Data Carpentry workshop!  

Hopefully this training helps you continue on your journey of being a teaching 
"performance artist", whether you've never taught a class before, or are a 40-year 
teaching veteran.
