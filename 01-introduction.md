Many metaphors can be used to describe teaching and learning: filling
up a container, lighting a fire, growing a seed, and more.  Our
favorite is to compare teachers to actors, musicians, athletes, and
other performing artists.  To become an accomplished performer, one
must learn:

* Theory: Learn about your discipline, make choices about your approach,
  choose drills, make a plan to train or practice
* Practice: Repeat the desired skill over and over, get feedback from other
  performers, and watch other performers to learn more.

One way that classical musicians weave together this type of training
is a *master class*.  In a master class, a group of students meet with
a master performer, to discuss theory and perform for each other with
the goal of receiving feedback and improving their performance.  Not
only is a master class a chance to practice and learn, it represents
the performers' membership and participation in a larger community.

This training aims to be a "master class" in teaching (with one
exception---the leader is not necessarily the only authoritative voice
in the room).  It won't just be about learning things in your head,
but practicing teaching together, sharing knowledge and insights.
We'll be covering:

* Theory: learning about how people learn, and some specific tools and techniques
  you can use as you prepare to teach.  The theory and tools will cover both
  general teaching, and practices specific to Software and Data Carpentry.
* Practice: actually doing some teaching and "performing", giving feedback to each other
  and discussing how we do things.

The goal of this training is not only to strengthen instructors'
teaching skills, but to connect instructors to each other in a small
community within the larger community of Software and Data Carpentry
instructors.  The "secret sauce" of Software and Data Carpentry lies
not in its lessons or workshops, but the community of people who are
dedicated to teaching computing and data skills as well as they
possibly can.

We hope this training provides you with what you need to be a Software or Data
Carpentry instructor, and introduces you to a community of like-minded people.
Hopefully this training helps you continue on your journey of being a teaching
"performance artist", whether you've never taught a class before, or are a 40-year
teaching veteran.
