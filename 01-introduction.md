Before we discuss how to teach and how to design lessons,
we need to define a few terms.

## Educational Psychology

*Educational psychology* is the study of how people learn.
It touches on everything from the neuropsychology of perception and the
mechanisms of memory to the sociology of school systems
and the philosophical question of what we actually mean by "learning"
(which turns out to be pretty complicated once you start looking beyond
the standardized Western classroom).

Within the broad scope of educational psychology,
this training will take a narrow *cognitivist* perspective.
We can afford to do this because most of our learners are
physically safe, well fed, well educated, and highly motivated.
Much of the research in education has rightly focused on people without these privileges.

> ## Other Perspectives
>
> There are many other perspectives outside cognitivist theory ---
> see [this site](http://www.learning-theories.com/) for summaries.
> Besides cognitivism, those encountered most frequently include
> *behaviorism* (which treats education as stimulus/response conditioning),
> *constructivism* (which considers learning an active process
> during which learners construct knowledge for themselves),
> and *connectivism* (which emphasizes the social aspects of learning,
> particularly those made possible by the Internet).
>
> The most interesting perspective from our point of view is
> *[situated learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situated_learning)*,
> which focuses on the way that
> *[legitimate peripheral practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimate_peripheral_participation)*
> leads to people becoming members of
> a *[community of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice)*.

## Instructional Design

While what we know about educational psychology can constrain teaching, we are
often challenged to accommodate our knowledge from the study of psychology with
the evidence from instructional practice, and with influence stemming from
instructor ideology.

This is because, in some cases, there might be a few different approaches to
teaching that could be used. Deciding which of these is consistent with what
we know about how brains learn can be difficult, and might appear to clash with
educational practitioners' ideology.

If educational psychology is the science, Instructional Design (ID) is the
engineering: it's how our scientific understanding is put into practice on the
ground.

For example,
most children today are taught to read using a bottom-up technique called
[phonics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonics),
which introduces them to the sounds of letters,
then puts those letters and their sounds together to make simple words like "bug" and "run",
then assembles the words into sentences and stories.
But another technique called [whole language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_language)
takes a different approach.
Instead of starting with letters,
its proponents teach children to recognize entire words
so that they get the positive feedback of being able to read whole stories as early as possible.
The basic idea is that once children find reading rewarding,
they'll be motivated to go back and figure out the letters.

These approaches are not equally consistent with what we know about how children
learn to read. There is some evidence that proficient, adult readers identify
whole word patterns. But humans are really good at associating sounds with
meaning, and the scientific consensus among linguists, psychologists and
neuroscientists is that the bridge phonics builds from letters to sounds makes
learning to read easier.


So while whole-word instruction takes an optimistic and student-centered view on
learning -- encouraging enjoyment in learning as a key element in the process --
it is not consistent with the scientific view of the way that learning to read
actually takes place. Nevertheless, when these methods were studied in
classrooms, the findings have been contradictory: while some classroom studies
find that phonics works best, others show that whole language yields better
results.

One explanation is that a third factor is at play.
If children sense that their teachers are enthusiastic about something,
they will respond to that enthusiasm and learn better.
If they feel their teachers are just marking time,
though,
they will emulate that instead.
Thus,
when studies are done by people who are proponents of a new technique
(as they often are),
they are likely to produce positive results,
but when those techniques are deployed more widely
to teachers who have seen one bandwagon after another roll by,
results will regress to the mean, or even beyond.

This course will cover several methods and tools of instructional design,
exploring their strengths and weaknesses,
and trying to connect them to the underlying research.

## Pedagogical Content Knowledge

In the end, effective teaching often depends on what the teacher knows.
The things teachers know can be divided into:

> ## Motivating Question
> How can we describe teaching and learning how to teach?  
{: .objectives}

> ## Learning Objectives
> Learners will describe the ways that learning to teach is comparable
> to learning a performing art.   
{: .objectives}

> ## Discussion
>
> What metaphors have you heard of to describe teaching and learning?  
{: .challenge}

There have been many metaphors to describe teaching and learning: filling up
a container (with knowledge), lighting a fire, growing a seed.  There may be
good reasons for each of these metaphors, but this training seeks to follow
a different path -- we will think of the potential instructor as a beginning performer: an
actor, musician, dancer, or similar performing artist.  

To become an accomplished performer, one must do the following:  

* Theory: Learn about your discipline, make choices about your approach,
choose drills, make a plan to train or practice
* Practice: Repeat the desired skill over and over, get feedback from other
performers, and watch other performers to learn more.  

One way that classical musicians weave together this type of training is a
"masterclass."  In a masterclass, a group of students meet with a master performer,
to discuss theory and perform for each other with the goal of receiving
feedback and improving their performance.  Not only
is a masterclass a chance to practice and learn, it represents the performers'
membership and participation in a larger community.  

This training aims to be a "masterclass" in teaching (with one exception - the leader
is not necessarily the only authoritative voice in the room).  It won't just be about
learning things in your head, but practicing teaching together, sharing  
knowledge and insights.  We'll be covering:

* Theory: learning about how people learn, and some specific tools and techniques
you can use as you prepare to teach.  The theory and tools will cover both
general teaching, and practices specific to Software and Data Carpentry.  
* Practice: actually doing some teaching and "performing", giving feedback to each other
and discussing how we do things.  

The goal of this training is not only to strengthen instructors' teaching skills,
but to connect instructors to each other in a small community within the larger community of
Software and Data Carpentry instructors.  The "secret sauce" of Software and Data Carpentry
lies not in its lessons
or workshops, but the community of people who are dedicated to teaching computing
and data skills as well as they possibly can.  

We hope this training provides you with what you need to be a Software or Data
Carpentry instructor, and introduces you to a community of like-minded people.  
Hopefully this training helps you continue on your journey of being a teaching
"performance artist", whether you've never taught a class before, or are a 40-year
teaching veteran.
