This training course only a start.
If you'd like to help us make it better,
we would welcome additions discussing:

*   how education research is done: qualitative studies, quantitative studies, and comparison studies
*   Dewey, Piaget, Vygotsky, Freire (or, key figures in 100 words each)
*   the history of distance education (or, everything old is new again)
*   MOOCs
*   are public schools actually failing?
*   computer-based homework/teaching systems
*   concept inventories
*   direct instruction vs. problem-based learning and inquiry-based learning
*   expertise in three parts: prior knowledge, knowledge frameworks, and metacognition
*   other forms of assessment
*   an overview of research on novice programmers
*   problem-solving skills overview
*   setting expectations in the classroom/promoting effective study habits
