> ## Skill Acquisition: What level are your teaching skills?
>
> As with computational skills, people have a tendency to think of teaching as something you are "just good at" or not. However, teaching is a skill, and expertise develops with attentive practice.
> Examine the descriptions of "novice," "competent practitioner," and "expert." Where do you think you fall with regard to teaching? What have you learned about teaching? What are you aware of that you still need to learn?
> Discuss with a partner and then write some thoughts in the Etherpad.
