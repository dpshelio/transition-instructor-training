#### Carpentries Member Site Instructor Training Calendar
###  January to August 2019

If you are with a member site ready to schedule your instructor training session, you should have received an email with a code for your team to register. People affiliated with member sites can register at any time during their membership term.

If you are joining through our open application program, applications are reviewed on a rolling basis.  Applicants who are accepted will receive a code to register for an event below.  Open applicants can register no earlier than one month before each event.

All trainings are offered online from 9 am to 5 pm in the time zone noted.  You do not need to be in the same time zone yourself but need to accommodate that time zone for the full 2-day event. A link is provided next to each event that will convert the start time to your local time zone.

Registration for each event closes one week before that event. You may change or cancel your registration up to one week before the event. Cancelations less than one week in advance and no-shows may result in forfeiting your seat.  We do make exceptions to this policy in limited circumstances (e.g. illness), so please do reach out to us at [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org) if there was an extenuating circumstance and we will be able to make alternative arrangements for you to join another training event.
