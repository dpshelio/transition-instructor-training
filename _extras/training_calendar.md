# The Carpentries Instructor Training Calendar: 2020

Trainees can register for events listed below by clicking on the link for that event and completing the registration through Eventbrite.  If you are with a member site ready to schedule your instructor training session, you should have received an email with a code for your team to register. People affiliated with member sites can register at any time during their site's membership term.

If you are joining through our open application program, applications are reviewed on a rolling basis.  Applicants who are accepted will receive a code to register for an event below.  Open applicants can register no earlier than one month before each event.

Most trainings are offered online from 9 am to 5 pm in the time zone listed (unless otherwise noted below). Select events run for shorter periods of time over several days. You do not need to be in the same time zone yourself but need to accommodate that time zone for the full event. A link is provided next to each event that will convert the start time to your local time zone.

Read more about our Instructor Training program [here]({{ page.root }}).

If you have not already done so, please be sure to also complete our [instructor training application](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/request_training/) so we can be sure you are in our system **in addition to** completing the registration on Eventbrite. The registration on Eventbrite secures your seat at an event; the application form ensures your information is in our system.    

The class will be hands-on throughout:
short lessons will alternate with individual and group practical exercises,
including practice teaching sessions.
Those who complete the two full days
and [some short follow-up exercises online]({{ page.root }}/checkout/)
will be certified to teach [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}), [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}), and [Library Carpentry]({{ site.lc_site }}) workshops.

Registration for each event closes one week before that event. You may change or cancel your registration up to one week before the event. Cancelations less than one week in advance and no-shows may result in forfeiting your seat.  We do make exceptions to this policy in limited circumstances (e.g. illness), so please do reach out to us at [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org) if there was an extenuating circumstance and we will be able to make alternative arrangements for you to join another training event.

**During the COVID-19 global pandemic, our Instructor Training offerings may be limited. We will add more events to this calendar as they are scheduled. Please contact team@carpentries.org if you have questions.  Thank you.**
