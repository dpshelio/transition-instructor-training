This training course only a start.
If you'd like to help us make it better,
we would welcome additions discussing:

*   how education research is done: qualitative studies, quantitative studies, and comparison studies
*   Dewey, Piaget, Vygotsky, Freire (or, key figures in 100 words each)
*   the history of distance education (or, everything old is new again)
*   MOOCs
*   computer-based homework/teaching systems
*   other forms of assessment
*   an overview of research on novice programmers
*   problem-solving skills overview
*   setting expectations in the classroom
*   promoting effective study habits

We would also appreciate additions to this list of things we *don't* do,
and explanations of why not:

peer instruction
:   This powerful teaching method has been proven effective,
    but we are already asking workshop participants to assimilate a lot of new things,
    and picking up a new learning technique while learning the basics of coding and data wrangling
    seems too much to ask.

certification
:   Many people have asked us to certify workshop participants in the same way that we certify instructors,
    but any meaningful certification process would require a lot of resources to set up and run.
