# Thank you for registering!

Thank you for registering for a Carpentries Instructor Training event. You should be getting an email from Eventbrite to confirm your registration.  If you have landed on this page without registering for an event, please visit [this page](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) for more information about our Instructor Training program or contact [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org).

Approximately one week before the event, you will receive information on how to connect to the videoconference.

To prepare for the Instructor Training workshop, please review our [instructor training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/).  This will give you an overview of what we'll be doing over the two days.  It also links to our [checkout process](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/) required to complete the certification process to teach Carpentries workshops.

You can read more about [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) and its lesson programs, [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/), and 
[Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/). Read about all the ways to [get involved](https://carpentries.org/community/) in The Carpentries, including signing up for [mailing lists](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/latest) and [newsletters](https://carpentries.org/newsletter/).

Registration for each event closes one week before that event. You may change or cancel your registration up to one week before the event. Cancelations less than one week in advance and no-shows may result in forfeiting your seat.  We do make exceptions to this policy in limited circumstances (e.g. illness), so please do reach out to us at [team@carpentries.org](mailto:team@carpentries.org) if there was an extenuating circumstance and we will be able to make alternative arrangements for you to join another training event.

We're excited to have you on board and look forward to having you officially join The Carpentries instructor community.  If you have any questions, please [contact us](mailto:team@carpentries.org).

*Note that in order to provide the best experience for our trainees, in rare instances events may be canceled due to low enrollment.  If this happens, you will be notified two weeks before the event and will have the opportunity to sign up for a future event.*
