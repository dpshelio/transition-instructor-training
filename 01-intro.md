Let's start by defining a few terms.
The first is *educational psychology*,
which is the study of how people learn.
This touches on everything from the neuropsychology of perception and the mechanisms of memory
to the sociology of school systems
and the philosophical question of what we actually mean by "learning"
(which turns out to be pretty complicated once you start looking beyond
the standardized Western classroom).

What we know about educational psychology constrains teaching,
but doesn't dictate it.
In particular,
there are often several plausible approaches to teaching
that are consistent with what we know about how brains learn.
In order to decide between them,
we need to explore *instructional design*,
which is the study of how to create learning materials.
If ed psych is science,
ID is engineering:
it's how understanding is put into practice.

For example,
most children today are taught to read using a bottom-up technique called
[phonics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonics),
which introduces them to the sounds of letters,
then puts those letters and their sounds together to make simple words like "bug" and "run",
then assembles the words into sentences and stories.
But another technique called [whole language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_language)
takes a different approach.
Instead of starting with letters,
its proponents teach children to recognize entire words
so that they get the positive feedback of being able to read whole stories as early as possible.
The basic idea is that once children find reading rewarding,
they'll be motivated to go back and figure out the letters.

Both approaches are consistent with what we know about how children learn,
so we need to study them in action to determine which is better.
The findings have been contradictory:
while some studies find that phonics works best,
others show that whole language yields better results.

One explanation is that a third factor is at play.
If children sense that their teachers are enthusiastic about something,
they will respond to that enthusiasm and learn better.
If they feel their teachers are just marking time,
though,
they will emulate that instead.
Thus,
when studies are done by people who are proponents of a new technique
(as they often are),
they are likely to produce positive results,
but when those techniques are deployed more widely
to teachers who have seen one bandwagon after another roll by,
results will regress to the mean.
