As homework overnight,
please read our [operations guide]({{ site.swc_site }}/workshops/operations/)
and the checklists it links to.
These recommendations and how-to guides summarize what we have learned
(often the hard way)
about organizing and running workshops.
When you arrive tomorrow,
we will ask you to add one question about our operations to a list;
we will then do our best to answer all of those questions during the day.

If you haven't done so already,
please also follow the [setup instructions]({{ site.root }}/setup/)
to install the software that we use when we teach a regular workshop.
You will need this for tomorrow' [live coding]({{ site.root }}/12-live/) exercise,
and it will also give you first-hand knowledge of what we ask our learners to do.

> ## End-of-Day Feedback
>
> We frequently ask workshop participants to give us feedback at the end
> of each day using a technique called "one up, one down".  The
> instructor asks the learners to alternately give one positive and one
> negative point about the day, without repeating anything that has
> already been said.  This requirement forces people to say things they
> otherwise might not: once all the "safe" feedback has been given,
> participants will start saying what they really think.
>
> When called upon by the instructor, add one positive or one negative
> point to the growing list *without* repeating anything that has
> already been said.
