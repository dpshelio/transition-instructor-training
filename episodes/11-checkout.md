The final steps in getting certified are detailed in
[the checkout guide][checkout].
Please note that:

1. You only have to do one lesson for a particular Carpentry in order
   to be certified as an instructor for it: if you qualify on one
   lesson, we'll trust you to familiarize yourself with others that
   you may want to teach.

2. Your exercise doesn't have to be accepted in order for you to
   become an instructor: the point of this exercise is to make sure
   that you understand the process and have met the people who review
   material.

3. We'd like to get everyone through this process within two months of
   training, so please get started as soon as you can.  Anyone who has
   not completed within three months should contact their trainer, or
   the head of instructor training, to discuss reasons and options.

## Discussion Sessions

Our discussion sessions are run as video conferences
and focus on the lesson of your choice from the Software and Data Carpentry curriculum.
Each session will be attended by a small group of instructor trainees like yourself
and will be led by an experienced instructor. 

This is an informal discussion for trainees to get more comfortable with the training material,
clarify anything that may be unclear,
and learn (if you are still unsure) how to provide feedback and contribute to the materials.

When preparing for the discussion session,
you can think about the following questions:

1. Did you feel like you would like to change the flow or present the concepts differently?
   If so, what and why?
2. Was there anything that you found unclear in the material?
   Did you get stuck anywhere?
3. What are some misconceptions that the students could develop when learning this material?
   Which bits of the module may be tricky and if poorly explained, they may lead the students to broken mental model? 
4. What prior knowledge do learners need to have before participating in this module (whole lesson)?
   If you were to list any prerequsites, what would they be? 

The first two questions are intended to help you become more comfortable with
[our collaborative lesson development methods][blog-collab-lesson].
While teaching from the material created by others may be a challenge at the beginning,
these materials have been developed collaboratively by people just like you.

The third and fourth question refer back to the instructor training course,
and are meant to give you a chance to apply some of what you've learned to these specific lessons.
