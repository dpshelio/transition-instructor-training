2.  take part in a discussion session with experienced instructors, and
3.  do a 5-minute live coding demo.

[This page]({{ site.root }}/checkout/) explains the procedure in

> ## One Up, One Down
>
> As explained in [the previous lesson]({{ site.root }}/20-practices/),
> we frequently ask workshop participants to give us feedback at the end
> of each day using a technique called "one up, one down".  The
> instructor asks the learners to alternately give one positive and one
> negative point about the day, without repeating anything that has
> already been said.  This requirement forces people to say things they
> otherwise might not: once all the "safe" feedback has been given,
> participants will start saying what they really think.
