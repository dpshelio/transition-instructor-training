## Instructor Checkout

The final three steps in qualifying as an instructor are to:

1.  make a contribution to a lesson's content, exercises, or instructor's guide by doing **one of the following**:
  1. submitting a change request to fix an existing issue
  2. proof-reading a lesson and adding a new issue describing something to be improved
  3. providing substantive feedback on an existing issue or PR
2. take part in a [discussion session](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/instructor-discussion) with experienced instructors
3. do a 5-minute live coding demo

[This page]({{ site.root }}/checkout/) explains the procedure in
detail; please review it with your instructor before you leave.

## Provide Feedback

**One up, one down.**
We frequently also ask for summary feedback at the end of each day. The instructors ask the learners to alternately give one positive and one negative point about the day, without repeating anything that has already been said. This requirement forces people to say things they otherwise might not: once all the “safe” feedback has been given, participants will start saying what they really think. Minute cards are anonymous; the alternating up-and-down feedback is not. Each mode has its strengths and weaknesses, and by providing both, we hope to get the best of both worlds.

> Provide [one up, one down]({{ site.root }}/20-practices/) feedback
