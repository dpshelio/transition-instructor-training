### Inclusivity

**Inclusivity** is a policy of including people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized.
A learning environment may be positive for some yet still be experienced as exclusive or marginalizing for others. Inclusivity is at the heart 
of [The Carpentries Core Values](https://carpentries.org/values/) -- we hope that this is a passion you share! In this section we will 
discuss the challenges, opportunities, and continuing effort involved in making your workshop a positive experience for all.


### Accessibility Issues

Barriers to accessibility encountered in a workshop are demotivating at best and can exclude a learner entirely. When it comes to accessibility, inclusivity 
means taking the time to give some thought to accessibility. What barriers might be present in your workshop, and what can you do to remove them?
For an in-person workshop, can you confirm that the building entrance and restrooms are fully accessible? For any workshop, what can you do to anticipate a 
spectrum of vision and hearing challenges that your learners may not be prepared to report? What other challenges can you think of?

While it may not be possible to accommodate everyone's needs,
it *is* possible to get a good working structure in place
without any knowledge of what specific disabilities people might have.
Having at least some accommodations prepared also makes it clear that
hosts and instructors care enough to have thought about problems in advance,
and that any additional concerns are likely to be addressed.

If you are in charge of advance communication with learners for your workshop, note that our [host template](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/workshop_administration/email_templates.html#email-learners-before-workshop) includes an inquiry regarding accessibility needs. However, be aware that many people will not feel comfortable requesting accommodations in advance, or at all if it can be avoided.
For example, a participant with minor hearing loss may simply hope that the workshop will be adequately amplified or captioned for them to get by. Taking steps to make your workshop maximally accessible can relieve your participants of the need to disclose personal information.

The first step is to know what you need to do. There are a number of good resources for learning
about accessibility.

> ## Learning about Accessibility
>
> The [UK Home Office](https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/category/accessibility/) has put together a set of posters of dos and don'ts for making
> visual and web-based materials more accessible for different populations. Take a look at one of
> [these posters](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/blob/master/accessibility/dos-donts/posters_en-UK/accessibility-posters-set.pdf) and
> put one thing you've learned in the Etherpad.
>
> Note: There are [translations](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility)
> available in a number of languages, including Dutch, French, Spanish, Swedish, Portuguese, German, and
> Chinese.
>
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

> ## Accessibility and PDFs
>
> The posters above are in PDF format - which itself can sometimes be inaccessible to people
> who use screen readers. If you know of a similar resource describing accessibility guidelines
> that would be more accessible than what's linked above, open an issue on our instructor

The [W3C Accessibility Initiative's checklist for presentations][w3c-accessible]
is a good starting point focused primarily on assisting the visually impaired,
while Liz Henry's blog post about
[accessibility at conferences][conference-accessibility]
has a good checklist for people with mobility issues,
and this [interview with Chad Taylor][deaf-accessibility]
is a good introduction to issues faced by those with no or limited hearing.

The second is to know how well you're doing.
For example,
sites like [WebAIM][webaim] allow you to check
how accessible your online materials are to users with no or limited vision.

The third,
and most important,
is to *involve people with disabilities in decision-making*.
Our mailing lists are a good place to ask for advice,
and updates to [our accessibility checklist](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/workshop_needs.html#accessibility)
are always welcome.

## Systemic Exclusion

As instructors, we can learn to avoid talking disparagingly about our learners' choice
of text editors and levels of technical knowledge. There are other factors, however, introduced by systemic forces 
beyond our control, that can contribute to demotivation and add to cogitive load. What we can control, in this case
is our own awareness of the challenges these forces present to learners. As with other demotivation pitfalls, we can also
think carefully about the language that we use and how we interact with our learners to avoid triggering or reinforcing systemic bias.

# Stereotypes

We all use stereotypes, and for good reason. They serve a cognitive purpose. One study suggests we encounter more than 34 gigabytes of information everyday. That is more information than we could ever process, so our brains' use shortcuts. Stereotypes are one of those shortcuts.  

## What are stereotypes?
They:
- are an established feature of human social cognition 
- are a set of characteristics that a perceiver associates with members of a group
- may be explicit (conscious and deliberate) or implicit (unconscious and automatic)
- guide what we notice about people 
- guide how we interpret people's behaviors
- can facilitate quick judgements in appropriate situations (e.g. stopping a child from driving a car)
- can lead to systematically negative attitudes and behaviors towards members of certain groups 


Stereotypes can demotivate learners in at least two ways: 
- Instructors may have stereotypes about learners 
    - They may treat certain learners differently, often without meaning to 
        - not giving the same attention to one Learner compared to another (may be less or more attention to a stereotyped group)
        - responding to questions with a dismissive or patronizing tone
- Learners may experience stereotypes about them  
    - They may believe that they are not as capable of learning compared with others, i.e. have a fixed mindset.
    - They may be distracted by reminders of stereotypes that affect them, increasing cognitive load and interfering with the learning process. This is known as **stereotype threat**.

## What can we do about these stereotypes?
- Get to know people from many different groups!
- Build awareness of situations in which your perceptions and behaviors are influenced by your own stereotypes
- Do not call attention to common stereotypes (that might activate stereotype threat (maybe we can link to our current stereotype threat content, but just as fyi)

### Impostor Syndrome

 *[Impostor syndrome][wikipedia-impostor-syndrome]* is the belief that one is not good enough for a job or position,
and that one's achievements are due to luck rather than talent or skill.
This is also accompanied by the fear of being "found out". 

![One stick figure introducing another to a third says, "This is Dr. Adams. She's a social psychologist and the world's top expert on imposter syndrome." Dr. Adams responds "Haha, don't be silly! There are lots of scholars who have made more significant - oh my god."](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/impostor_syndrome.png)

Academic work is frequently undertaken alone or in small groups but the results are shared and
criticized publicly. In addition,
we rarely see the struggles of others, only their finished work, which can feed the belief that everyone
else finds it easy. Women and minority groups, who already feel additional pressure to prove themselves in
some settings, [may be particularly affected][high-achieving-women].


Two ways of dealing with your own impostor syndrome are:

1.  Ask for feedback from someone you respect and trust.
    Ask them for their honest thoughts on your strengths and achievements,
    and commit to believing them.
2.  Look for role models.
    Who do you know who presents as confident and capable?
    Think about how they conduct themselves.
    What lessons can you learn from them?
    What habits can you borrow?
    (Remember, they quite possibly also feel as if they are making it up as they go.)

As an instructor,
you can help people with their impostor syndrome by
sharing stories of mistakes that you have made or things you struggled to learn.
This reassures the class that it's OK to find topics difficult.
Being open with the group makes it easier to build trust and make learners confident to ask questions.
(Live coding is great for this:
typos let the class see you're not superhuman.)

You can also emphasize that you want questions:
you are not succeeding as a teacher if no one can follow your class,
so you're asking learners to help you learn and improve.
Remember,
it's much more important to *be* smart than to *look* smart.

The Ada Initiative has
[some excellent resources][ada-initiative-resources]
for teaching about and dealing with imposter syndrome.

> you made a mistake that seemed silly or embarrassing. Is that task still hard for you?
> In the Etherpad, describe how you might use this as a motivational story to help your learners

>
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

## Setting Expectations with the Code of Conduct

Finally, a important way that The Carpentries fosters an inclusive, respectful
learning environment is our [Code of Conduct]({{ site.coc }}).

To make clear what is expected,
all participants in our workshops are required to conform to the
[Code of Conduct]({{ site.coc }}).
 Its details are important,
but the most important thing about it is that it exists:
knowing that we have rules
tells people a great deal about our values
and about what kind of learning experience they can expect.

We will discuss the Code of Conduct in greater detail tomorrow.


# Graveyard (delete)
In computing, it means making a positive effort to be more welcoming to women,
people of color, people with various sexual orientations,
the elderly, people with physical disabilities, the formerly incarcerated,
the economically disadvantaged, and everyone else who doesn't fit Silicon Valley's white/Asian male demographic.
Lee's paper
"[What can I do today to create a more inclusive community in CS?]({{ page.root }}/files/papers/lee-create-inclusive-community-2015.pdf)"
is a brief, practical guide with references to the research literature.
These help learners who belong to one or more marginalized or excluded groups,
but help motivate everyone else as well.

Many of these can be applied to our workshops,
such as:

*   asking learners to email you before the workshop
    to explain how they believe the training could help them achieve their goals;
*   reviewing notes to make sure they are free from gendered pronouns,
    that they include culturally diverse names,
    etc.;
*   emphasizing that what matters is the rate at which they are learning,
    not the level of knowledge they had when they started;
*   encouraging pair programming; and
*   actively mitigating behavior that some learners may find intimidating,
    e.g.,
    use of jargon or "questions" that are actually asked to display knowledge.
    
    

If you look at [our old lesson on Python][swc-python-v4],
you'll find that the text beside the slides includes all of the narration---but
none of the Python source code.
Someone using a [screen reader][wikipedia-screen-reader]
would therefore be able to hear what was being said about the program,
but wouldn't know what the program actually was.


### Stereotype Threat
Reminding people of negative stereotypes,
even in subtle ways, can create distracting anxiety about the risk of confirming those stereotypes, in turn reducing
their performance. This is called *[stereotype threat][wikipedia-stereotype-threat]*,
and the clearest examples in computing are gender-related. Depending on whose numbers you trust,
only 12-18% of programmers are women, and those figures have actually been getting worse over the last 20 years.
There are many reasons for this (see Margolis and Fisher's *[Unlocking the Clubhouse][worldcat-clubhouse]*
and Margolis's *[Stuck in the Shallow End][worldcat-shallow-end]*). Steele's *[Whistling Vivaldi][worldcat-whistling-vivaldi]*
summarizes what we know about stereotype threat in general and presents some strategies for mitigating it in
the classroom.

While there's lots of evidence that unwelcoming climates demotivate members of under-represented groups,
it's not clear that stereotype threat is the underlying mechanism. Part of the problem is that
[the term has been used in many ways][shapiro-neuberg-stereotype-threat].
Another is that there are [questions about the replicability of key studies][jussim-stereotype-threat].
What *is* clear is that we need to avoid thinking in terms of a deficit model
(i.e., we need to change the members of under-represented groups because they have some deficit,
such as lack of prior experience) and instead use a systems approach
(i.e., we need to change the system because it produces these disparities). We
can also not highlight people based on their identity with a minority group; for
example, it's not a good idea to say something like "I'm so glad you're here because
we don't get enough women in programming." That may sound positive,
but draws attention to the stereotype that women aren't good at programming.
