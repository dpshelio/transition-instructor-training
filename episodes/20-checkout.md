In this short episode, we will take a moment to review the actions you will
need to take after this training to become a fully certified Carpentries Instructor.  


## Instructor Checkout

After completing the Instructor Training workshop, there are three final steps to complete before qualifying as an Instructor. 
Briefly, the three steps are:

1.  Make (and send us a link to) a small contribution to a lesson or glossary.
2.  Take part in an online community discussion session.
3.  Take part in an online teaching demonstration session.


All trainees have 3 months (90 days) from the end date of your training to complete checkout. If you need more time,
3-month extensions may be requested by emailing [checkout@carpentries.org](mailto: checkout@carpentries.org). 
Extensions may be granted for any reason up to 1 year from your training date.


## 1. Lesson Contributions

### Keep It Simple!

**The purpose of the lesson contribution is to demonstrate that you are prepared to draw upon your experience teaching our lessons to
contribute towards their maintenance and improvement in the future.** For this reason, we suggest starting small! Consider commenting
on an existing issue, fixing a typo if you find one, or contributing a single term to our multilingual glossary. If you would like
to help us out with something meaningful, have a look at our [Help Wanted page][help-wanted]. 

### Eligible Repositories
Contributions to repositories not managed by The Carpentries, including forks of Carpentries repositories, are not eligible for
checkout contributions. This is because The Carpentries Code of Conduct does not apply outside of Carpentries spaces. 

We recommend that contributions be directed to:
* any [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}/lessons/), [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}/lessons/), or [Library Carpentry]({{ site.lc_site }}/lessons/) lesson
* any [community developed lesson][carpentries-incubator]
* our open source, multilingual glossary of data science terms, [Glosario][glosario-github]

Except for Glossario, **please be cautious about proposing new content or exercises**. Most of our lessons are full to bursting! 
The greater challenge, in most cases, is identifying where and how to cut. 

### Contributing on GitHub
Each lesson repository has a document, named `CONTRIBUTING.md`, that outlines contribution guidelines. The one for this repository
is [here][contributing]. Maintainers for each repository may choose to customize their own guidelines.

For a detailed guide to using GitHub for Carpentries contributions, see this
community-[contributed guide](https://github.com/dmgt/swc_github_flow/blob/master/for_novice_contributors.md)

### Alternatives to GitHub
All Carpentries lesson materials (including this one!) are hosted on GitHub. Learning to interact on GitHub can have many benefits,
including the ability to interact with and contribute to other open-source projects! However, we understand that there are many
reasons why trainees may wish to avoid engaging on GitHub. That's ok!

For this checkout task, you may email your contribution to [checkout@carpentries.org](mailto: checkout@carpentries.org).
Be sure to include a link to the lesson or site that you are addressing in your contribution. A Carpentries Core Team member will 
add your contribution to the relevant repository on your behalf (e.g. by creating an issue), and will send you a link so that
you may view any responses by the maintainers. 

### What Comes Next?
If you submit your own contribution, be sure to send an email with a link to [checkout@carpentries.org](mailto: checkout@carpentries.org). Pay attention to GitHub notifications in case the Maintainers or others have follow-up questions or 
requests. However, also keep in mind that Carpentries lesson Maintainers, like Instructors, are mostly volunteers! Some repositories are vigorously
maintained; others may have slower response times. Do not take it personally if your contribution does not get a prompt response.
**Your contribution does not need to be reviewed or accepted in order for you to become an Instructor**.

## 2. Community Discussion

The purpose of having you attend a Community Discussion meeting is to introduce you to other members of our global community
and the valuable resource they offer as you develop your teaching practice. 

Community Discussion meetings occur several times a week and may take different forms. The most common type of Community Discussion 
meeting is designed to support Instructors in preparing to teach an upcoming workshop and to provide a forum for sharing
lessons learned by those who have recently taught. If there are no workshops to discuss on the agenda, then the facilitator will 
lead a conversation about teaching and preparing to teach, engaging the interests of participants. These meetings are most often 
led by a member of the Instructor Development committee or The Carpentries Core Team.

In some cases, a Community Discussion meeting may be used for regional community-building, to invite the community to connect
with representatives from specific Carpentries committees or subcommunities, or to address a theme of special interest to our
community. 

When signing up on the [Etherpad][discussion], be sure to examine the description of your event carefully. Also, be sure to double check
the time zone, and be sure to mark your calendar after signing up! At the time of the event, the Zoom link may be found at the top
of the Etherpad.

### Not Just for Checkout!
Community Discussion meetings are an excellent opportunity to
get help as you prepare to teach and to engage in vital reflection on your practice while connecting with a community of like-
minded Instructors. You are invited to attend these at any time! If you think you might enjoy hosting them, or developing 
other opportunities for Instructors, consider joining the Instructor Development Committee. 

### Getting Credit
After each Community Discussion meeting, hosts submit a form that includes the names of attendees who identified themselves as
fulfilling their checkout requirement. This is indicated by writing "checkout" next to your name in the Etherpad. As long as you
indicate that you are completing checkout, it is not necessary to email us after you have attended your meeting.

## 3. Teaching Demonstration

The teaching demonstration serves several purposes. First and foremost, it is an opportunity to **both give and receive feedback** on
a more polished presentationm after you have had some time to reflect on your lesson and what you have learned in this workshop. In 
addition, it is an opportunity to **spend some time preparing to teach** well in advance of your first workshop. This will ease your
preparations when the date of that workshop approaches. Finally, it is an opportunity to receive feedback from a **Carpentries 
Instructor Trainer** (like your Trainers at today's event), who can help you make sure you are prepared for a strong start.

### Not a High Stakes Test
It can be nerve-wracking to perform in front of others! This is true when you teach, too. As much as possible, try to relax and
enjoy this friendly opportunity for feedback and connection with others in our community.

In some cases, an Instructor Trainer may ask you to repeat your teaching demonstration another time prior to certification. If this
happens, they will be very clear about exactly what they would like you to change on your second appearance, and why. These requests
are made with your interests in mind -- we want you to be prepared for success when you set out to teach! 

Trainers draw from their own experience and training when they evaluate teaching demonstrations, but we do provide a 
[rubric][demos-rubric] for their reference. This can be a helpful resource as you prepare. 

### 1 Lesson = Many Episodes
For your teaching demonstration, you will prepare to teach a lesson from one of the
Carpentries lesson programs. You can refer to the lists of [Software Carpentry lessons]({{ site.swc_site }}/lessons/), [Data Carpentry lessons]({{ site.dc_site }}/lessons/), and [Library Carpentry lessons]({{ site.lc_site }}/lessons/) on the websites. 

A lesson corresponds to a single line in the lesson table and a single repository in GitHub.
(An example of a lesson: [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis][r-gapminder].
Some lessons have supplementary modules.
You do not need to be prepared to teach the supplementary modules for your teaching demonstration.

You will be asked to teach a short segment from your chosen lesson from this
[list of suggested episodes][start-points].
The host of the session will pick a segment of the lesson for you to teach on the day of the
demonstration (An example for a segment could be: [Data Structures][r-gapminder-episode], so you must be prepared to teach any part of 
your chosen lesson. Note that, because we are particularly interested in your use of participatory live coding (or participatory 
work with spreadsheets etc.), you will not be asked to teach segments of a lesson that are entirely expository or that have dependencies or 
other complications to set up.

### Sign Up and Set Up 
Select a session that works for you on the [the teaching demo schedule Etherpad]({{page.demopad}}), and sign up by adding
your name and lesson of choice to the Etherpad. Be sure to double check the time in your local time zone by clicking on the converter 
link posted. Also, examine the demo description to ensure that it is not a special session targeting a specific sub-community or 
language (unless you are part of that target group). 

The link to connect to the video conference is at the top of the Etherpad. Your Trainer may send an email with confirmation and/or 
additional instructions prior to your demo. If possible, plan to use a headset with built in microphone for the best audio experience. 

### During the Demo
For your demonstration(s), you will screen-share and live code (or comparable) for 5 minutes. You may use whatever notes you want, but 
please do not display them on your screen. Teach as you would in an actual workshop.
When your five minutes are up, the trainer leading the session will call time,
and then you and everyone else taking part in the session will give feedback on your teaching.
You will be asked to give feedback on yourself as well as on others;
your Trainer will likely recommmend a feedback structure using two axes of positive vs. negative
and content vs. presentation, just as you have done during this workshop.

### Languages Other than English
If you want to do your demonstration in a language other than English,
please let us know in advance so that we can attempt to find someone to moderate.
We may not be able to accommodate all languages.

### Getting Credit
After each Teaching Demonstration, Trainers submit a form that includes the names and passing status of each attendee. They will
also email you to let you know, as this information is typically not shared during the demo session. It is not necessary to email us 
after you have attended your teaching demonstration.

## 4. Tracking Your Progress
After you complete this workshop, your application will be matched to your training record and a profile will be created in The 
Carpentries database, AMY. If you already have a profile, [this link should take you to your profile][trainee-profile]. Check your email for instructions on logging in. As you complete your steps toward checkout, these 
will appear as completed in your profile.

Keeping your profile up to date with a current email address and local airport helps us to keep in touch about teaching 
opportunities. You may also adjust your preferences to select whether you want to have your GitHub profile shared on our 
[Instructors page][instructors-page]. 

## 5. Congratulations!
Approximately 1-2 weeks after your last step is complete, you should receive an email with your Carpentries Instructor badge. Hooray!

### What does a badge mean?
* **You can teach any Carpentries workshops** While your badge will indicate a lesson program that you selected for checkout, all Carpentries Instructor badges are valid to teach any Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, or Library Carpentry lesson. While co-Instructors need not be badged, every Carpentries branded workshop must have at least one badged Instructor to lead the way. (More on branding in the next episode!)
* **You get to vote** Badged Instructors are eligible to vote in Carpentries Executive Council elections for their first year, and for all subsequent years in which they continue to participate through teaching or other involvement. See [this section from the Carpentries Bylaws][voting-rights] for rules governing continuing voting eligibility.
* **You can register for Carpentries Bonus Modules** New to The Carpentries in 2020, we are now offering short continuing education [modules][bonus-modules] for certified Instructors. The first of these targets preparing to teach online. Look out for more topics coming soon!
* **You can share the news** Looking for language to add to showcase your skills and experience on a CV or resume? [Here is some text][text-for-instructors] to get you started!
