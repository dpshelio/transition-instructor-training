In this short episode, we will take a moment to review the actions you will
need to take after this training to become a fully certified Carpentries Instructor.  


## Instructor Checkout

After completing the Instructor Training workshop, there are three final steps to complete before qualifying as an Instructor. 
Briefly, the three steps are:

1.  Make (and send us a link to) a small contribution to a lesson or glossary.
2.  Take part in an online community discussion session.
3.  Take part in an online teaching demonstration session.


All trainees have 3 months (90 days) from the end date of your training to complete checkout. If you need more time,
3-month extensions may be requested by emailing [checkout@carpentries.org](mailto: checkout@carpentries.org). 
Extensions may be granted for any reason up to 1 year from your training date.


## 1. Lesson Contributions

### Keep It Simple!

**The purpose of the lesson contribution is to demonstrate that you are prepared to draw upon your experience teaching our lessons to
contribute towards their maintenance and improvement in the future.** For this reason, we suggest starting small! Consider commenting
on an existing issue, fixing a typo if you find one, or contributing a single term to our multilingual glossary. If you would like
to help us out with something meaningful, have a look at our [Help Wanted page][help-wanted]. 

### Eligible Repositories
Contributions to repositories not managed by The Carpentries, including forks of Carpentries repositories, are not eligible for
checkout contributions. This is because The Carpentries Code of Conduct does not apply outside of Carpentries spaces. 

We recommend that contributions be directed to:
* any [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}/lessons/), [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}/lessons/), or [Library Carpentry]({{ site.lc_site }}/lessons/) lesson
* any [community developed lesson](https://carpentries.org/community-lessons/)
* our open source, multilingual glossary of data science terms, [Glosario][glosario-github]

Except for Glossario, **please be cautious about proposing new content or exercises**. Most of our lessons are full to bursting! 
The  greater challenge, in most cases, is where and how to cut. 

### Contributing on GitHub
Each lesson repository has a document, named `CONTRIBUTING.md`, that outlines contribution guidelines. The one for this repository
is [here][contributing]. Maintainers for each repository may choose to customize their own guidelines.

For a detailed guide to using GitHub for Carpentries contributions, see this
community-[contributed guide](https://github.com/dmgt/swc_github_flow/blob/master/for_novice_contributors.md)

### Alternatives to GitHub
All Carpentries lesson materials (including this one!) are hosted on GitHub. Learning to interact on GitHub can have many benefits,
including the ability to interact with and contribute to other open-source projects! However, we understand that there are many
reasons why trainees may wish to avoid engaging on GitHub. That's ok!

For this checkout task, you may email your contribution to [checkout@carpentries.org](mailto: checkout@carpentries.org).
Be sure to include a link to the lesson or site that you are addressing in your contribution. A Carpentries Core Team member will 
add your contribution to the relevant repository on your behalf (e.g. by creating an issue), and will send you a link so that
you may view any responses by the maintainers. 

### What Comes Next?
If you submit your own contribution, be sure to send an email with a link to [checkout@carpentries.org](mailto: checkout@carpentries.org). Pay attention to GitHub notifications in case the Maintainers or others have follow-up questions or 
requests. However, also keep in mind that Carpentries lesson Maintainers, like Instructors, are mostly volunteers! Some repositories are vigorously
maintained; others may have slower response times. Do not take it personally if your contribution does not get a prompt response.
**Your contribution does not need to be reviewed or accepted in order for you to become an Instructor**.

## 2. Community Discussion

The purpose of having you attend a Community Discussion meeting is to introduce you to other members of our global community
and the valuable resource they offer as you develop your teaching practice. 

Community Discussion meetings occur several times a week and may take different forms. The most common type of Community Discussion 
meeting is designed to support Instructors in preparing to teach an upcoming workshop and to provide a forum for sharing
lessons learned by those who have recently taught. If there are no workshops to discuss on the agenda, then the facilitator will 
lead a conversation about teaching and preparing to teach, engaging the interests of participants. These meetings are most often 
led by a member of the Instructor Development committee or The Carpentries Core Team.

In some cases, a Community Discussion meeting may be used for regional community-building, to invite the community to connect
with representatives from specific Carpentries committees or subcommunities, or to address a theme of special interest to our
community. 

When signing up on the [Etherpad][discussion], be sure to examine the description of your event carefully. Also, be sure to double check
the time zone, and be sure to mark your calendar after signing up! 

### Not Just for Checkout!
Community Discussion meetings are an excellent opportunity to
get help as you prepare to teach and to engage in vital reflection on your practice while connecting with a community of like-
minded Instructors. You are invited to attend these at any time! If you think you might enjoy hosting them, or developing 
other opportunities for Instructors, consider joining the Instructor Development Committee. 

### Getting Credit
After each Community Discussion meeting, hosts submit a form that includes the names of attendees who identified themselves as
fulfilling their checkout requirement. This is indicated by writing "checkout" next to your name in the Etherpad. As long as you
indicate that you are completing checkout, it is not necessary to email us after you have attended your meeting.

## 3. Teaching Demonstration




___________________________

2.  Take part in a [community discussion][discussion] with experienced Instructors.
3.  Prepare to teach a full Carpentries lesson (i.e. the content of one lesson repository). Then perform a 5-minute [live coding demo][demo] for that lesson starting at a point chosen by the session lead.



> ## Carpentries Tools: Etherpad
>
> The Etherpad is a widely used tools in Carpentries workshops and many other activities in the community.
> There are etherpads about a many topics, like the two linked in the checkout instructions above.
> To make them all findable, the Carpentries manage a ["pad of pads"](https://pad.carpentries.org/pad-of-pads).
> This is a great one to bookmark and use as a reference throughout your checkout process and as a newly minted member
> of The Carpentries community.
>
{: .callout}

> ## Checking Out Review with Questions and Answers
>
> In small groups, read and discuss one of the three checkout procedures listed above and described in detail at [this page]({{ page.root }}/checkout/).
> Make notes in the Etherpad and when you are done, report back to the full group about the requirements for that stage of the process.
> What questions do you still have about the checkout process?
>
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
{: .challenge}

> ## Schedule a Discussion or Demo
>
> Visit the [discussion Etherpad][discussion] to sign up for a session.
> If the session you would like to attend is full, contact the discussion
> host and co-host to ask if you can attend.
>
> If you would prefer to do your teaching demonstration before your discussion,
> visit the [demo Etherpad][demo] and sign up there. This demo [rubric]({{ page.root }}/demos_rubric/) is provided as a guide for Trainers evaluating potential new Instructors during the teaching demonstration.
>
> __Note:__
> When you're scheduling you may see extra information on some sessions. These
> sessions may be themed (community discussions) or sub community focused(teaching demos)
> , be careful to select a session that matches your interests and needs. A themed
> Community Discussion may not leave you time to ask questions about your upcoming
> workshop. A focused teaching demo may, for example, be offered in a language
> other than English.
>
>
> This exercise should take 5 minutes.

### Lesson Contribution

The lesson materials are hosted on GitHub:

*   [Data Carpentry on GitHub]({{ site.dc_github }})
*   [Library Carpentry on GitHub]({{ site.lc_github }})
*   [Software Carpentry on GitHub]({{ site.swc_github }})
*   [Community-developed lessons on GitHub][carpentries-incubator]

and are developed collaboratively.  Each lesson is in a separate
repository, and consists of narrative lesson material and an
associated directory containing the data or scripts needed in the
lesson.  This source material is also then served as a website, using
GitHub's "gh-pages" feature.

Lesson contribution is managed within the repository using "issues"
and "pull requests".  New problems or suggestions can be introduced
as issues, discussed by the community, and addressed via a pull
request, which serves as a "request" to make changes, and can also
be discussed before changes are merged.

If contributing on GitHub is new for you, see this [guide](https://github.com/dmgt/swc_github_flow/blob/master/for_novice_contributors.md)
that is customized to the Carpentries workflow.


> ## Help Wanted: Breaking Down Barriers
>
> At The Carpentries, we know all too well that tools and technical procedures can present a serious barrier to progress. 
> That is why we exist! So we appreciate the irony when participation in our community demands tools or technical 
> procedures that may not be familiar or accessible to all who wish to contribute. GitHub, in particular is often recognized as an obstacle;
> this is something our community has [discussed extensively][git-blog].
>
> We are actively invested in making our processes as friendly and inclusive as possible, and that includes supporting our 
> community in surmounting the barriers presented by our own technologies of choice. Watch our channels for 
> opportunities to develop your skills as a contributor! In the mean time, if you
> have any ideas about how we can make our resources more contributor-friendly,
> please [let us know][contact-page].

### What is in a Badge?

Once you have completed all checkout steps, within about 2 weeks you will receive an email with your Instructor badge! What does this mean?
* **You get to teach!** Badged Instructors are certified to co-teach any Carpentries lesson. All Carpentries Instructor badges are acceptable to teach any Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, or Library Carpentry lesson. While non-badged instructors may also co-teach, every Carpentries branded workshop must have one badged Instructor to lead the way.
* **You get to vote!** Badged Instructors are eligible to vote in Carpentries Executive Council elections for their first year, and for all subsequent years in which they continue to participate through teaching or other involvement. See [this section from the Carpentries Bylaws](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#eligibility-rights-and-termination-for-voting-members) for rules governing continuing voting eligibility.
* **You have something to brag about!** Looking for language to add to showcase your skills and experience? [Here is some text](https://github.com/carpentries/commons/blob/master/text-for-instructors.md) to get you started!


> ## Check Out the Discussion (Optional)
>
> As an instructor, your voice is important! We want you to be actively involved
> in discussions about the lesson materials (and other aspects of The Carpentries community).
> Go to the GitHub page for the lesson you worked with over the past two days and click on the
> "Issues" tab. Read through some of the discussions and, if you have anything to add, please add it
> to the conversation! If you wish to make a pull request, be sure to examine the contribution guidelines for
> the repository you are working in. If you do make a significant contribution to the discussion, send a link to
> the issue to [checkout@carpentries.org](mailto: checkout@carpentries.org). Congratulations! You have
> just completed one of the three remaining steps in becoming a Carpentries Instructor.
>
> Leave about 5-10 minutes for this exercise.
{: .challenge}


> ## Ongoing support
>
> Discussion sessions are not only for instructors-in-training working towards their certification.
> Instructors are highly encouraged to participate in discussions before and after each of their workshops,
> so that they can continue to learn from each other and advance their teaching skills. For even more support, consider
> participating in our Carpentries [Mentoring program][mentoring]!
