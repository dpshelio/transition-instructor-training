> ## Round Two
> First, have a look at the [rubric](https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/blob/gh-pages/files/teaching-demo-rubric.md) that is given to trainers as a suggested framework for evaluating the online teaching demonstration sessions that are part of instructor checkout. 
> Does this rubric make sense? Take a moment to think about things you'd like to do differently with your next live coding
> practice. This is also a good time to ask questions about teaching demonstration.
>
> Next, get back into the same groups you did your live coding with. 
> Take turns re-teaching your chosen live coding session, making sure to incorporate changes based on the feedback you received and any new ideas based on reading the rubric. 
> Give feedback to each
> other using the rubric this time. When you are finished, add some thoughts on this process to the Etherpad:
> What did you change? Did it work better or worse with the change? How might you do it if you were to teach it again?
>
>  This exercise should take about 25 minutes for teaching, plus 15 minutes for pre and post discussion.
