Teaching and learning are not the same process. As we have seen so far, there are many things an instructor can do when teaching to facilitate the cognitive processes
necessary for learning to occur. But **any technique can fall flat when learners are not motivated**. And demotivation is contagious!
Indeed "the students just are not motivated" is a common refrain among teachers facing burn-out after years of ineffectual effort. 

It is true that learner motivation is influenced by many factors well beyond the control of an instructor, including individual background and systemic forces.
However, there are many things you can do to cultivate motivation in your classroom, and perhaps more importantly, to **avoid doing harm** to the precious drive your 
learners bring to the classroom on day one. 

The fact is that there is only so much technical learning that can occur during a 2-day workshop. Novices do not emerge from Carpentries workshops as competent 
practitioners. Short-format training of this kind is situated in the context of *self training*, in which learners begin to develop a roadmap during a workshop of this kind but from there largely proceed on their own. We are a launch point with a guide rail. Therefore, while a need for technical learning is our *raison 
d'etre*, **cultivating motivation to continue that learning, and to carefully pursue best-practices in doing so, is arguably the most important outcome we can achieve**.

This section discusses several ways that
learners can be motivated (or demotivated!) by instrutional content and practices, and provides practice opportunities
for you to become confident in motivating your learners.

## How Does Content Influence Motivation?

People learn best when they care about a topic and believe they can master it with a reasonable investment of time and effort.
Many scientists might appreciate the value of programming
but believe that developing useful skills will take more time than they have available.
This presents a problem because **believing that something will take a long time
to learn often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy**.

One way to combat this problem is to begin a lesson with something that is **quick to learn and immediately useful**. 
It is particularly important that *learners* see it as useful in their daily work.
This not only motivates them,
it also helps build their confidence in us,
so that if it takes longer to get to something they find useful in a later topic,
they will persist with the lesson.

Imagine a graph whose axes are labelled "mean time to master" and "usefulness once mastered".
Tasks that are quick to master and immediately useful should ideally be taught first;
things in the opposite corner
that are time-consuming to learn and have little near-term application
should be avoided in our workshops.

![A stylized graph with y-axis labeled "usefulness once mastered" and and x-axis labeled "mean time to master". The upper left quadrant says "teach this first" and the lower right quadrant says "don't bother".](../fig/what-to-teach.png)

Another way to think about the graph shown above is "authentic tasks."
An authentic task is exactly what it sounds like -- a real task performed
by someone doing their work. If you can identify authentic tasks from your
own work that could be useful to others, these examples will be highly
motivating.

> ## Authentic Tasks: Think, Pair, Share
>
> **Think** about some task you did this week that uses one or more of the skills we teach,
> (e.g. wrote a function, bulk downloaded data, built a plot in R, forked a repo)
> and explain how you would use it (or a simplified version of it) as an exercise or example in class.
> **Pair** up with your neighbor and decide where this exercise fits on a graph of "short/long time to master" and "low/high usefulness". 
> In the class Etherpad, **share** the task and where it fits on the graph.
> As a group, we will discuss how these relate back to our "teach most immediately useful first" approach.
>
> This exercise and discussion should take about 10 minutes.

> If you are new to teaching, try to ask an experienced instructor for feedback before trying out a new exercise.

While we aim to begin workshops with motivating content, in practice this does not always occur. Workflow-based content like that taught in Data Carpentry
workshops may start at the beginning of the workflow, for example. And even when a 'motivating example' is built in to the start of a workshop, technical 
problems like software installation can turn those precious first minutes into an experience of frustration and impatience. That is ok! What is important is to
**be mindful of times when your content is not motivating**, and to strategize your rescue using some of the other techniques in this section.

## How Can Instructional Approach Influence Motivation?

In addition to teaching things that will make our learners' lives easier and focusing
on authentic tasks, there are a number of other strategies we can use to motivate
learners.

> ## Brainstorming Motivational Impacts
>
> Think back to courses you have taken in the past and consider things that an instructor has said or done that you found either **motivating** or **demotivating**. 
> Try to think of one example in each case, and share your example under the appropriate heading in the etherpad. 
>
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

### Inviting Participation

Motivation is supported by active engagement. This allows learners to ask questions, resolving roadblocks quickly, and demonstrate knowledge, building 
confidence. However, in a room full of strangers, most learners will not immediately feel comfortable speaking up, especially when they feel 
confusion or doubt. Creating a motivating classroom means inviting communication and reinforcing that invitation with an attentive response.

A few ways to invite participation are:

+ **Establishing norms for interaction**. This can be done by creating procedures for communication, e.g. turn taking in discussions, passing around a 'talking stick', or encouraging quieter people to contribute. Having, discussing, and enforcing a [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) also provides a framework for positive communication to occur. 
+ **Encouraging learners to learn from each other**. Working in pairs, or "[pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)," encourages learners to communicate with each other about their learning process, reinforcing memory and making it more likely that points of confusion will be expressed and resolved. This can also address challenges of having a mixture of background experience: asking more advanced learners to help beginner learners is a good way to maximize learning for both. In these cases, make sure the less experienced learner is the one doing the typing!
+ **Acknowledging when learners are confused**. In addition to rewarding learners for expressing confusion, acknowledging and exploring that confusion will contribute to your growth as an instructor, filling in your expert awareness gaps. Formative assessments can be used to pinpoint learners' misunderstandings. When learners see that others share their confusion, this helps them develop confidence in sharing their own uncertainties.

### Encouraging a Growth Mindset

People vary in how they conceptualize intelligence and skill development. In academic environments, people are often praised as "talented" or having "high ability" in certain areas, and may develop an identity around being a certain "type of person" who has inherent strengths or weaknesses.

The impact of belief that ability or inteligence is born rather than made -- dubbed a **fixed mindset** by Carol Dweck -- is a continuing topic of research and debate. However, in Carpentries workshops we frequently encounter learners who believe that they are not "computational people," and Instructors often report that this fixed mindset interferes with motivation to engage fully with the task of learning to program. We therefore recommend three types of interventions that have been shown to influence mindset, encouraging learners to believe that ability can be acquired through effort -- a **growth mindset**.

+ **Positive error framing**. Errors are an inevitable part of learning any new skill, and they can be particularly intimidating and frustrating when learning to 
program. Many learners will automatically interpret errors as indicators of inability -- adopting a fixed mindset. Encouraging learners to understand errors in a 
positive way -- as an opportunity to learn something they would have missed had they not encountered the error -- reinforces a growth mindset and helps them to 
stay motivated in the face of challenge. Be sure to discuss this with your helpers before a workshop begins, as they are the ones who will most often guide your learners through the process of responding to error they have made.


> ## Helping Learners Learn From Mistakes (optional)
> A learner at your workshop asks for your help with an exercise and shows you their attempt at solving it. You see they've made an error
> that shows they misunderstand something fundamental about the lesson (for example, in the shell lesson, they forgot to put a space between
> `ls` and the name of the directory they are looking at). What would you say to the learner?
>
> In the Etherpad, describe the error your learner has made and how you would respond.
>
> This exercise and discussion should take about 5 minutes.
{: .challenge}


+ **Presenting the instructor as a learner**. Admitting that you don't know everything is part of showing that it is acceptable to make mistakes. Using 
[participatory live coding]({{ page.root }}/14-live/), our chosen method for teaching concepts, is very useful for this reason. It is common to make errors while 
coding. Embrace these with enthusiasm! When handled openly, these errors can be very instructive for novice learners -- both with regard to technical details and 
in demonstrating how to frame errors in a positive light. If you are unlucky and fail to make any useful mistakes, sharing stories about your learning process can help here, too.

> ## Typos
> The typos are the pedagogy.
> — Emily Jane McTavish
{: .testimonial}

+ **Praising effort or improvement, not performance or ability**. Praise based on the quality of performance often feels like the highest praise because it goes 
straight to your identity as a person of intellect and skill. When faced with a fixed mindset, many well-intentioned teachers will end up countering with another 
fixed mindset -- "I'm not a computational person" vs "You ARE a computational person!" However, this approach doesn't prepare learners well to interpret future obstacles as irrelevant to innate ability. Evidence suggests that learner perseverence is best supported in the long term by praising effort or improvement instead. If you are not convinced of this, consider the impact on the person sitting next to your target, who might overhear but not receive the same praise.

> ## Choosing our Praises
> Since we're so used to being praised for our performance, it can be challenging to change the way we praise our learners. Which of these
> are examples of performance-based, effort-based, or improvement-based praise?
>
> - That's exactly how you do it -- you haven't gotten it right yet, but you've tried two different strategies to solve that problem. Keep it up!
> - You're getting to be really good at that. See how it pays to keep at it?
> - Wow, you did that perfectly without any help. Have you thought about taking more computing classes?
> - That was a hard problem. You didn't get the right answer, but let's look at what you learned trying to solve it!
> - Look at that - you're a natural!
>
>> ## Solution
>> - Effort-based.
>> - Improvement-based.
>> - Performance-based.
>> - Improvement-based.
>> - Performance-based. 
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

+ **Leveraging the Power of "Yet"**. A request for help might start with "I can't ___ " or "I don't understand ___ ". Depending on the attitude of the learner, 
these can sound like statements of fact rather than requests for help! Adding the word "yet" to the end of these sentences helps emphasize that being a novice is 
a temporary state, and encourages a growth mindset towards progress. 



### First, Do No Harm!

When learning a skill, we develop more than expert awareness gaps -- we also develop Opinions about tools and methods, and sometimes create a professional identity around having technical expertise. While sometimes useful for a boost or a laugh in conversation with fellow experts, these can all present serious hazards in the classroom! Here are a few **things you should not do in your classroom:**

*   **Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool or practice**, or the people who use them. Regardless of
    its shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool, and may have invested many years in learning to do so.
    Convincing someone to change their practices is much harder when
    they think you disdain them. 
*   **Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion** with the one or
    two people in the audience who clearly don't actually need to be
    there. Reserve those conversations for breaks or follow-up emails.
*   **Pretend to know more than you do**.  People will actually trust you
    more if you are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and
    will be more likely to ask questions and seek help. (Also see "Presenting the instructor as a learner," above)
*   **Use the J word ("just") or other demotivating words** we talked about in a
    [previous lesson]({{ page.root }}/03-expertise/). These signal to the learner that
    the instructor thinks their problem is trivial
    and by extension that they therefore must be stupid
    for not being able to figure it out.
*   **Take over the learner's keyboard**. It is rarely a good idea to type anything for your learners.
    Doing so can be demotivating for the learner (as it implies you don't think they can do it themselves or
    that you don't want to wait for them). It also wastes a valuable opportunity for your learner to develop muscle memory and other
    skills that are essential for independent work. 
*   **Express surprise at unawareness**. Saying things like "I can't believe you don't know X"
    or "You've never heard of Y?" signals to the learner that they do not have
    some required pre-knowledge of the material you are teaching, that they don't belong at the workshop,
    and it may prevent them from asking questions in
    the future. (For more on this see the Recurse Center's [Social Rules][recurse-social-rules]).

It can be difficult to avoid these demotivators entirely. Some people are so used to
complaining about Windows with their friends, or talking about how terrible Excel is
that they initially fail to realize they're doing it while teaching. Teaching yourself
to avoid these types of comments takes practice, but is well worth the effort. No one
likes to be made fun of, and talking badly about people who use GUIs, or who aren't
writing their thesis in LaTeX is unlikely to make them excited about learning your
favorite scripting language. This is another important conversation to have in advance with your helpers, as well.

## Systemic and Psychological Demotivators

As instructors, we can learn to avoid talking disparagingly about our learners' choice
of text editors and levels of technical knowledge. There are other factors, however, that contribute to demotivation,
some of which are either systemic, or built into our psychological makeup as human beings. We can't
always control these demotivators - often they come from outside classrom - but we can
be aware of them, and take certain actions to lessen their impact by thinking carefully about
the language that we use and how we interact with our learners.

### Stereotype Threat
One major psychological demotivator is *stereotype threat*. Reminding people of negative stereotypes,
even in subtle ways, can make them anxious about the risk of confirming those stereotypes, in turn reducing
their performance. This is called *[stereotype threat][wikipedia-stereotype-threat]*,
and the clearest examples in computing are gender-related. Depending on whose numbers you trust,
only 12-18% of programmers are women, and those figures have actually been getting worse over the last 20 years.
There are many reasons for this (see Margolis and Fisher's *[Unlocking the Clubhouse][worldcat-clubhouse]*
and Margolis's *[Stuck in the Shallow End][worldcat-shallow-end]*). Steele's *[Whistling Vivaldi][worldcat-whistling-vivaldi]*
summarizes what we know about stereotype threat in general and presents some strategies for mitigating it in
the classroom.

While there's lots of evidence that unwelcoming climates demotivate members of under-represented groups,
it's not clear that stereotype threat is the underlying mechanism. Part of the problem is that
[the term has been used in many ways][shapiro-neuberg-stereotype-threat].
Another is that there are [questions about the replicability of key studies][jussim-stereotype-threat].
What *is* clear is that we need to avoid thinking in terms of a deficit model
(i.e., we need to change the members of under-represented groups because they have some deficit,
such as lack of prior experience) and instead use a systems approach
(i.e., we need to change the system because it produces these disparities). We
can also not highlight people based on their identity with a minority group; for
example, it's not a good idea to say something like "I'm so glad you're here because
we don't get enough women in programming." That may sound positive,
but draws attention to the stereotype that women aren't good at programming.

### Impostor Syndrome

Another major psychological demotivator is *[impostor syndrome][wikipedia-impostor-syndrome]*.
Imposter syndrome is the belief that one is not good enough for a job or position,
and that one's achievements are due to luck rather than talent or skill.
This is also accompanied by the fear of being "found out".

![One stick figure introducing another to a third says, "This is Dr. Adams. She's a social psychologist and the world's top expert on imposter syndrome." Dr. Adams responds "Haha, don't be silly! There are lots of scholars who have made more significant - oh my god."](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/impostor_syndrome.png)

Academic work is frequently undertaken alone or in small groups but the results are shared and
criticized publicly. In addition,
we rarely see the struggles of others, only their finished work, which can feed the belief that everyone
else finds it easy. Women and minority groups, who already feel additional pressure to prove themselves in
some settings, [may be particularly affected][high-achieving-women].

Two ways of dealing with your own impostor syndrome are:

1.  Ask for feedback from someone you respect and trust.
    Ask them for their honest thoughts on your strengths and achievements,
    and commit to believing them.
2.  Look for role models.
    Who do you know who presents as confident and capable?
    Think about how they conduct themselves.
    What lessons can you learn from them?
    What habits can you borrow?
    (Remember, they quite possibly also feel as if they are making it up as they go.)

As an instructor,
you can help people with their impostor syndrome by
sharing stories of mistakes that you have made or things you struggled to learn.
This reassures the class that it's OK to find topics difficult.
Being open with the group makes it easier to build trust and make learners confident to ask questions.
(Live coding is great for this:
typos let the class see you're not superhuman.)

You can also emphasize that you want questions:
you are not succeeding as a teacher if no one can follow your class,
so you're asking learners to help you learn and improve.
Remember,
it's much more important to *be* smart than to *look* smart.

The Ada Initiative has
[some excellent resources][ada-initiative-resources]
for teaching about and dealing with imposter syndrome.

### Accessibility Issues

Not providing equal access to lessons and exercises
is about as demotivating as it gets.
If you look at [our old lesson on Python][swc-python-v4],
for example,
you'll find that the text beside the slides includes all of the narration---but
none of the Python source code.
Someone using a [screen reader][wikipedia-screen-reader]
would therefore be able to hear what was being said about the program,
but wouldn't know what the program actually was.

While it may not be possible to accommodate everyone's needs,
it *is* possible to get a good working structure in place
without any knowledge of what specific disabilities people might have.
Having at least some accommodations prepared also makes it clear that
hosts and instructors care enough to have thought about problems in advance,
and that any additional concerns are likely to be addressed.

The first step is to know what you need to do. There are a number of good resources for learning
about accessibility.

> ## Learning about Accessibility
>
> The [UK Home Office](https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/category/accessibility/) has put together a set of posters of dos and don'ts for making
> visual and web-based materials more accessible for different populations. Take a look at one of
> [these posters](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/blob/master/accessibility/dos-donts/posters_en-UK/accessibility-posters-set.pdf) and

>

> available in a number of languages, including Dutch, French, Spanish, Swedish, Portuguese, German, and
> Chinese.
>
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
{: .challenge}

> ## Accessibility and PDFs
>
> The posters above are in PDF format - which itself can sometimes be inaccessible to people
> who use screen readers. If you know of a similar resource describing accessibility guidelines
> that would be more accessible than what's linked above, open an issue on our instructor
> training curriculum respoistory here: https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/issues
{: .callout}

The [W3C Accessibility Initiative's checklist for presentations][w3c-accessible]
is a good starting point focused primarily on assisting the visually impaired,
while Liz Henry's blog post about
[accessibility at conferences][conference-accessibility]
has a good checklist for people with mobility issues,
and this [interview with Chad Taylor][deaf-accessibility]
is a good introduction to issues faced by those with no or limited hearing.

The second is to know how well you're doing.
For example,
sites like [WebAIM][webaim] allow you to check
how accessible your online materials are to users with no or limited vision.

The third,
and most important,
is to *involve people with disabilities in decision-making*.
Our mailing lists are a good place to ask for advice,
and updates to [our accessibility checklist](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/workshop_needs.html#accessibility)
are always welcome.

### Inclusivity

*Inclusivity* is a policy of including people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized.
In computing, it means making a positive effort to be more welcoming to women,
people of color, people with various sexual orientations,
the elderly, people with physical disabilities, the formerly incarcerated,
the economically disadvantaged, and everyone else who doesn't fit Silicon Valley's white/Asian male demographic.
Lee's paper
"[What can I do today to create a more inclusive community in CS?]({{ page.root }}/files/papers/lee-create-inclusive-community-2015.pdf)"
is a brief, practical guide with references to the research literature.
These help learners who belong to one or more marginalized or excluded groups,
but help motivate everyone else as well.

Many of these can be applied to our workshops,
such as:

*   asking learners to email you before the workshop
    to explain how they believe the training could help them achieve their goals;
*   reviewing notes to make sure they are free from gendered pronouns,
    that they include culturally diverse names,
    etc.;
*   emphasizing that what matters is the rate at which they are learning,
    not the level of knowledge they had when they started;
*   encouraging pair programming; and
*   actively mitigating behavior that some learners may find intimidating,
    e.g.,
    use of jargon or "questions" that are actually asked to display knowledge.

## Setting Expectations with the Code of Conduct

Finally, a important way that The Carpentries fosters an inclusive, respectful
learning environment is our [Code of Conduct]({{ site.coc }}).

To make clear what is expected,
all participants in our workshops are required to conform to the
[Code of Conduct]({{ site.coc }}).
 Its details are important,
but the most important thing about it is that it exists:
knowing that we have rules
tells people a great deal about our values
and about what kind of learning experience they can expect.

We will discuss the Code of Conduct in greater detail tomorrow.

(She's written a very accessible popularized [summary][worldcat-dweck] of her findings. There's also a [short summary][cardiff-dweck] available.)

*Positive error framing* is the process of presenting errors as an integral part of the learning process and using them as teaching opportunities. Error framing encourages learners to understand that making errors provides valuable learning opportunities instead
of having negative consequences. For example, the [Language Acquisition Made Practical](http://www.worldcat.org/title/language-acquisition-made-practical-field-methods-for-language-learners/oclc/935845446?referer=di&ht=edition) (LAMP)
system for learning language encourages learners to develop phrases and try them in a variety of social situations with native speakers. By
being willing to make mistakes, LAMP learners receive useful feedback from native speakers in real-world social situations. Error framing has
shown to be useful in learning complex tasks such as programming. In one study, Steele-Johnson showed that error framing showed
[positive effects on metacognition and self-efficacy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617273).

How can we incorporate error framing into our lessons? We need to reduce the negative emotions associated with errors, instead casting errors
as a "[natural part of learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292881989_Enhancing_firm_performance_and_innovativeness_through_error_management_culture)".

## Perseverance Predicts Success

Finally, have you ever thought about how the quality of persistence can
impact someone's learning?

Angela Duckworth, a Psychology professor from University of Pennsylvania, suggests that something called *grit* is an essential trait in
learning. Grit can be defined as [perseverance and passion in the face of difficulty towards a defined long term goal](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cvg1mbz0xrfx25l/DuckworthGross2014.pdf).
Learners with grit are willing to fail in their pursuit if they feel that it gets them closer to their goal. Learning and recovering
from failure is an essential skill in many fields. Learners with grit have shown to have a higher degree of success later on in
life. However, grit is not an innate trait; there is much evidence that suggests that grit is a trait that can be learned and instilled in
learners.

There are many ways we can help our learners attain grit.

- *Modeling resilience by sharing experiences of struggle*. Sharing your own experiences of having difficulty learning certain computing
concepts may help learners understand that the process of learning can be difficult. Sharing failures that were learning experiences may aid in
modeling resilience.
- *Promoting Perseverance*. Part of grit is being able to push through even when things are difficult. Improvement-based praise is an
important motivating tool to promote perseverance.
- *Sharing Passion*. Talking about why you persist in working in your field despite the difficulties and challenges is another way to instill
grit.
- *Emphasizing Long-Term Goals*. Showing the effects of learning the concepts in terms of learners' individual long-term goals can instill
passion and drive for learning despite the difficulties of the topic.

## Habits of Lifelong Learners

Adopting beliefs and qualities like those listed above will help people become
lifelong learners. By helping learners develop the habits of lifelong learning,
we are not only preparing them to learn beyond the workshop, but hopefully,
contributing to their overall career success. Surviving the job market nowadays requires the ability
to be a lifelong learner, in order to learn and adapt to new skills that may
be required by employers. Many of these positions can be described as *Knowledge Work*, work that requires
["non-routine" problem solving](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/kpm.378). Knowledge workers need to be capable of what Cal
Newport calls "[deep work](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/)": defined as the "ability to focus intensely on cognitively
demanding tasks".

Lifelong learning arises from those who have the growth mindset. Both grit and
[curiosity](https://blog.udacity.com/2017/02/grit-yes-curiosity.html) have been identified as
[success factors in lifelong learning](https://www.enterrasolutions.com/lifelong-learners-embrace-curiosity-grit/).
Often, the process of learning is a difficult journey. By modeling "gritty" behavior and how it has helped us achieve
long-term goals, we can foster a "learn-it-all" rather than a "know-it-all" attitude in learners.

Emphasizing the role of [help-seeking behavior in the lifelong learning process](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Learning_theories_in_practice/Help-seeking)
is important, as it is a critical skill of lifelong learners. Encouraging learners to seek help can be difficult when societal norms view
seeking help as "stigmatizing, self-threatening behavior".
Because of this, we need to reframe help-seeking behavior as a
positive behavior to cope with difficulties. Part of this reframing can be modeled by instructors emphasizing that they are also lifelong learners
and by admitting the limits of their knowledge. Emphasizing that one's cohort is a powerful source of help is important to establishing a
positive learning community.
