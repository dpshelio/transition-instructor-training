In the morning we covered some educational research and how we can apply it
to teaching Carpentries workshops.  Part of this afternoon will cover
another important aspect of being a Carpentries Instructor: fostering a
positive learning environment.

Teaching and learning are not the same process. As we have seen so far, there are many things an instructor can do to facilitate the cognitive processes
necessary for learning to occur. But any technique can fall flat when learners are not motivated. And demotivation is contagious!
Indeed "the students just are not motivated" is a common refrain among teachers facing burn-out after years of ineffectual effort. 

It is true that learner motivation is influenced by many factors well beyond the control of an instructor, including individual background and systemic forces.
However, there are many things you can do to cultivate motivation in your classroom, and perhaps more importantly, to avoid doing harm to the precious drive your 
learners bring to the classroom on day one. 

This section discusses typical ways that
learners can be motivated (or demotivated!) by instrutional content and practices, and provides practice opportunities
for you to become confident in motivating your learners.

## How Does Content Influence Motivation?

People learn best when they care about a topic and believe they can master it with a reasonable investment of time and effort.
Many scientists might appreciate the value of programming
but believe that developing useful skills will take more time than they have available.
This presents a problem because **believing that something will take a long time
to learn often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy**.

One way to combat this problem is to begin a lesson with something that is **quick to learn and immediately useful**. 
It is particularly important that *learners* see it as useful in their daily work.
This not only motivates them,
it also helps build their confidence in us,
so that if it takes longer to get to something they find useful in a later topic,
they will persist with the lesson.

Imagine a graph whose axes are labelled "mean time to master" and "usefulness once mastered".
Everything that is quick to master, and immediately useful should ideally be taught first;
things in the opposite corner
that are time-consuming to learn and have little near-term application
should be avoided in our workshops.

![A stylized graph with y-axis labeled "usefulness once mastered" and and x-axis labeled "mean time to master". The upper left quadrant says "teach this first" and the lower right quadrant says "don't bother".](../fig/what-to-teach.png)

Another way to think about the graph shown above is "authentic tasks."
An authentic task is exactly what it sounds like -- a real task performed
by someone doing their work. If you can identify authentic tasks from your
own work that could be useful to others, these examples will be highly
motivating.

While we aim to begin workshops with motivating content, in practice this does not always occur. Workflow-based content like that taught in Data Carpentry
workshops may start at the beginning of the workflow, for example. And even when a 'motivating example' is built in to the start of a workshop, technical 
problems like software installation can turn those precious first minutes into an experience of frustration and impatience. That is ok! What is important is to
**be mindful of times when your content is not motivating**, and to strategize your rescue using some of the other techniques in this section.

## How Can Instructional Approach Influence Motivation?

In addition to teaching things that will make our learners' lives easier and focusing
on authentic tasks, there are a number of other strategies we can use to motivate
learners.

>
> Think back to courses you have taken in the past and consider things that an instructor has said or done that you found either *motivating* or *demotivating*. 
> Try to think of one example in each case, and share your example under the appropriate heading in the etherpad. 
>
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

### Inviting Participation

Motivation is supported by active engagement. This allows learners to ask questions, resolving roadblocks quickly, and demonstrate knowledge, building 
confidence. However, in a room full of strangers, most learners will not immediately take it upon themselves to speak up, especially when they feel 
confusion or doubt. Creating a motivating classroom means inviting communication and reinforcing that invitation with an attentive response.

+ *Establishing norms for interaction*. This can be done by creating procedures for communication, e.g. turn taking in discussions, passing around a 'talking stick', or encouraging quieter people to contribute. Having, discussing, and enforcing a [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) also provides a framework for positive communication to occur. 
+ *Encouraging learners to learn from each other*. Working in pairs encourages learners to communicate with each other about their learning process, reinforcing memory and making it more likely that points of confusion will be expressed and resolved. This can also address challenges of having a mixture of background experience: asking more advanced learners to help beginner learners is a good way to maximize learning for both.
+ *Acknowledging when learners are confused.* In addition to rewarding learners for expressing confusion, acknowledging and exploring that confusion will contribute to your growth as an instructor, filling in your expert awareness gaps. Formative assessments can be used to pinpoint learners' misunderstandings. When learners see that others share their confusion, this helps them develop confidence in sharing their own uncertainties.

### Encouraging a Growth Mindset

People vary in how they conceptualize intelligence and skill development. In academic environments, people often become accustomed to being praised as "talented" or having "high ability" in certain areas, and may develop an identity around being a certain "type of person" who has inherent strengths or weaknesses.

The impact of this kind of philosophy of mind -- called "mindset" by Carol Dweck -- is unclear, but in Carpentries workshops it is extremely common to encounter learners who believe that they are not "computational people," and Instructors often report that this mindset interferes with motivation to engage fully with the task of learning to program.

## How Not to Demotivate Your Learners

Motivation can go both ways. Besides using strategies to motivate learners,
one of our additional challenges as instructors
is to not **demotivate** participants through our words or actions. None of us goes into
a workshop with the intention of creating a hostile environment or making the learners
hate the tools we're teaching, but we can all accidentally do just that if we don't
pay attention to what we say and how we interact with our learners. We'll discuss some
common demotivators and help you develop strategies for avoiding them.

> ## Brainstorming Demotivational Experiences
>
> *Think* back to a time when you were demotivated as a student (or when you demotivated a student).
> *Pair* up with your neighbor and discuss what could have been done differently in the situation to make it not demotivating.
> *Share* your story in the Etherpad.
>
> If time, what themes do you see among the stories?  What are positive actions you could take to avoid these?
>
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

### Things You Shouldn't Do in a Workshop

*   Tell learners they are rubbish because they use Excel and/or Word,
    don't modularize their code, etc.
*   Say negative things about Windows and praise Linux, e.g., say that
    the former is for amateurs.
*   Criticize GUI applications (and by implication their users) and
    describe command-line tools as the One True Way.
*   Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool. Regardless of
    its shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool.
    Convincing someone to change their practices is much harder when
    they think you disdain them.
*   Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or
    two people in the audience who clearly don't actually need to be
    there.
*   Pretend to know more than you do.  People will actually trust you
    more if you are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and
    will be more likely to ask questions and seek help.
*   Use the J word ("just") or other demotivating words we talked about in a
    [previous lesson]({{ page.root }}/03-expertise/). These signal to the learner that
    the instructor thinks their problem is trivial
    and by extension that they therefore must be stupid
    for not being able to figure it out.
*   Take over the learner's keyboard. It is rarely a good idea to type anything for your learners.
    Doing so can be demotivating for the learner (as it implies you don't think they can do it themselves or
    that you don't want to wait for them). It also wastes a valuable opportunity for your learner to develop muscle memory and other
    skills that are essential for independent work.
*  Feign surprise. Saying things like "I can't believe you don't know X"
    or "You've never heard of Y?" signals to the learner that they do not have
    some required pre-knowledge of the material you are teaching, that they don't belong at the workshop,
    and it may prevent them from asking questions in
    the future. (For more on this see the Recurse Center's [Social Rules][recurse-social-rules]).

It can be difficult to avoid these demotivators entirely. Some people are so used to
making fun of Windows-users with their friends, or talking about how terrible Excel is
that they initially fail to realize they're doing it while teaching. Teaching yourself
to avoid these types of comments takes practice, but is well worth the effort. No one
likes to be made fun of, and talking badly about people who use GUIs, or who aren't
writing their thesis in LaTeX is unlikely to make them excited about learning your
favorite scripting language.

## Systemic and Psychological Demotivators

As instructors, we can learn to avoid talking disparagingly about our learners' choice
of text editors and levels of technical knowledge. There are other factors, however, that contribute to demotivation,
some of which are either systemic, or built into our psychological makeup as human beings. We can't
always control these demotivators - often they come from outside classrom - but we can
be aware of them, and take certain actions to lessen their impact by thinking carefully about
the language that we use and how we interact with our learners.

### Stereotype Threat
One major psychological demotivator is *stereotype threat*. Reminding people of negative stereotypes,
even in subtle ways, can make them anxious about the risk of confirming those stereotypes, in turn reducing
their performance. This is called *[stereotype threat][wikipedia-stereotype-threat]*,
and the clearest examples in computing are gender-related. Depending on whose numbers you trust,
only 12-18% of programmers are women, and those figures have actually been getting worse over the last 20 years.
There are many reasons for this (see Margolis and Fisher's *[Unlocking the Clubhouse][worldcat-clubhouse]*
and Margolis's *[Stuck in the Shallow End][worldcat-shallow-end]*). Steele's *[Whistling Vivaldi][worldcat-whistling-vivaldi]*
summarizes what we know about stereotype threat in general and presents some strategies for mitigating it in
the classroom.

While there's lots of evidence that unwelcoming climates demotivate members of under-represented groups,
it's not clear that stereotype threat is the underlying mechanism. Part of the problem is that
[the term has been used in many ways][shapiro-neuberg-stereotype-threat].
Another is that there are [questions about the replicability of key studies][jussim-stereotype-threat].
What *is* clear is that we need to avoid thinking in terms of a deficit model
(i.e., we need to change the members of under-represented groups because they have some deficit,
such as lack of prior experience) and instead use a systems approach
(i.e., we need to change the system because it produces these disparities). We
can also not highlight people based on their identity with a minority group; for
example, it's not a good idea to say something like "I'm so glad you're here because
we don't get enough women in programming." That may sound positive,
but draws attention to the stereotype that women aren't good at programming.

### Impostor Syndrome

Another major psychological demotivator is *[impostor syndrome][wikipedia-impostor-syndrome]*.
Imposter syndrome is the belief that one is not good enough for a job or position,
and that one's achievements are due to luck rather than talent or skill.
This is also accompanied by the fear of being "found out".

![One stick figure introducing another to a third says, "This is Dr. Adams. She's a social psychologist and the world's top expert on imposter syndrome." Dr. Adams responds "Haha, don't be silly! There are lots of scholars who have made more significant - oh my god."](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/impostor_syndrome.png)

Academic work is frequently undertaken alone or in small groups but the results are shared and
criticized publicly. In addition,
we rarely see the struggles of others, only their finished work, which can feed the belief that everyone
else finds it easy. Women and minority groups, who already feel additional pressure to prove themselves in
some settings, [may be particularly affected][high-achieving-women].

Two ways of dealing with your own impostor syndrome are:

1.  Ask for feedback from someone you respect and trust.
    Ask them for their honest thoughts on your strengths and achievements,
    and commit to believing them.
2.  Look for role models.
    Who do you know who presents as confident and capable?
    Think about how they conduct themselves.
    What lessons can you learn from them?
    What habits can you borrow?
    (Remember, they quite possibly also feel as if they are making it up as they go.)

As an instructor,
you can help people with their impostor syndrome by
sharing stories of mistakes that you have made or things you struggled to learn.
This reassures the class that it's OK to find topics difficult.
Being open with the group makes it easier to build trust and make learners confident to ask questions.
(Live coding is great for this:
typos let the class see you're not superhuman.)

You can also emphasize that you want questions:
you are not succeeding as a teacher if no one can follow your class,
so you're asking learners to help you learn and improve.
Remember,
it's much more important to *be* smart than to *look* smart.

The Ada Initiative has
[some excellent resources][ada-initiative-resources]
for teaching about and dealing with imposter syndrome.

> ## Overcoming Imposter Syndrome (Optional)
>
> Think of a time when learning something was difficult for you, or
> you made a mistake that seemed silly or embarrassing. Is that task still hard for you?
> In the Etherpad, describe how you might use this as a motivational story to help your learners

>
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
{: .challenge}

### Accessibility Issues

Not providing equal access to lessons and exercises
is about as demotivating as it gets.
If you look at [our old lesson on Python][swc-python-v4],
for example,
you'll find that the text beside the slides includes all of the narration---but
none of the Python source code.
Someone using a [screen reader][wikipedia-screen-reader]
would therefore be able to hear what was being said about the program,
but wouldn't know what the program actually was.

While it may not be possible to accommodate everyone's needs,
it *is* possible to get a good working structure in place
without any knowledge of what specific disabilities people might have.
Having at least some accommodations prepared also makes it clear that
hosts and instructors care enough to have thought about problems in advance,
and that any additional concerns are likely to be addressed.

The first step is to know what you need to do. There are a number of good resources for learning
about accessibility.

> ## Learning about Accessibility
>
> The [UK Home Office](https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/category/accessibility/) has put together a set of posters of dos and don'ts for making
> visual and web-based materials more accessible for different populations. Take a look at one of

>
> Note: There are [translations](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/tree/master/accessibility)
> available in a number of languages, including Dutch, French, Spanish, Swedish, Portuguese, German, and
> Chinese.
>
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
{: .challenge}

> ## Accessibility and PDFs
>
> The posters above are in PDF format - which itself can sometimes be inaccessible to people
> who use screen readers. If you know of a similar resource describing accessibility guidelines
> that would be more accessible than what's linked above, open an issue on our instructor
> training curriculum respoistory here: https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/issues
{: .callout}

The [W3C Accessibility Initiative's checklist for presentations][w3c-accessible]
is a good starting point focused primarily on assisting the visually impaired,
while Liz Henry's blog post about
[accessibility at conferences][conference-accessibility]
has a good checklist for people with mobility issues,
and this [interview with Chad Taylor][deaf-accessibility]
is a good introduction to issues faced by those with no or limited hearing.

The second is to know how well you're doing.
For example,
sites like [WebAIM][webaim] allow you to check
how accessible your online materials are to users with no or limited vision.

The third,
and most important,
is to *involve people with disabilities in decision-making*.
Our mailing lists are a good place to ask for advice,
and updates to [our accessibility checklist](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/workshop_needs.html#accessibility)
are always welcome.

### Inclusivity

*Inclusivity* is a policy of including people who might otherwise be excluded or marginalized.
In computing, it means making a positive effort to be more welcoming to women,
people of color, people with various sexual orientations,
the elderly, people with physical disabilities, the formerly incarcerated,
the economically disadvantaged, and everyone else who doesn't fit Silicon Valley's white/Asian male demographic.
Lee's paper
"[What can I do today to create a more inclusive community in CS?]({{ page.root }}/files/papers/lee-create-inclusive-community-2015.pdf)"
is a brief, practical guide with references to the research literature.
These help learners who belong to one or more marginalized or excluded groups,
but help motivate everyone else as well.

Many of these can be applied to our workshops,
such as:

*   asking learners to email you before the workshop
    to explain how they believe the training could help them achieve their goals;
*   reviewing notes to make sure they are free from gendered pronouns,
    that they include culturally diverse names,
    etc.;
*   emphasizing that what matters is the rate at which they are learning,
    not the level of knowledge they had when they started;
*   encouraging pair programming; and
*   actively mitigating behavior that some learners may find intimidating,
    e.g.,
    use of jargon or "questions" that are actually asked to display knowledge.

## Setting Expectations with the Code of Conduct

Finally, a important way that The Carpentries fosters an inclusive, respectful
learning environment is our [Code of Conduct]({{ site.coc }}).

To make clear what is expected,
all participants in our workshops are required to conform to the
[Code of Conduct]({{ site.coc }}).
 Its details are important,
but the most important thing about it is that it exists:
knowing that we have rules
tells people a great deal about our values
and about what kind of learning experience they can expect.

We will discuss the Code of Conduct in greater detail tomorrow.

# Mindset
Our beliefs and attitudes about learning can impact how we learn! In this section
we examine how learners can create a "positive learning environment" for themselves
by how they think about learning; and how to model these behaviors as an instructor.

## The Importance of Mindset

One example of how our beliefs impact learning is Carol Dweck's theory of "mindset".

Dweck, a professor of Psychology at Stanford University, has conducted decades of research focused on understanding
people's attitudes towards ability, our beliefs about whether ability is ingrained or developed, and how those beliefs
affect our perseverance in learning. She's discovered that, in any given area, people tend to have either a fixed mindset - believing that
someone's ability in that area is intrinsic, you're either born with it or you're not - or a growth mindset - believing that, with enough effort,
almost anyone can learn almost anything. (She's written a very accessible popularized [summary][worldcat-dweck] of her findings. There's also a [short summary][cardiff-dweck] available.)

Do you believe that you're just not good at math? Or maybe you're not artistic? Not good at sports? If any of these
sound like you, you probably have a fixed mindset when it comes to mathematical, artistic and/or athletic ability.
People with a fixed mindset tend to avoid effort and to give up when faced with failure or challenge. They also
tend to take fewer risks, be less likely to take an opportunity to learn something new and to feel best about themselves when they perform flawlessly.
In contrast, people with a growth mindset tend to actively seek challenges and to work harder when faced with failure. They regularly take risks and
take advantage of opportunities for learning new skills. In fact, initial difficulties in a topic make them more interested and motivated to learn!

People who believe that ability is intrinsic view every situation as a test. A failure indicates that they don't have the natural ability they need
to succeed. Thus, students with a fixed-mindset will *decrease* their study time after receiving a poor exam score, because they see this score as a
judgment that they aren't good at that subject and shouldn't waste their time trying. In the same situation, a growth-mindset student will increase
the amount of time that
they study, seeing the poor score as an indication that they need to try harder to improve in that area.

Their attitude towards failure leads fixed-mindset people to avoid situations where they will be required to perform. They will not volunteer to answer
questions in class or to demonstrate a sports technique to their team. This tendency prevents fixed-mindset people from using opportunities to practice
and receive feedback, which, [as we've discussed]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/02-practice-learning.md %}), is essential to learning.

> ## Does Mindset Matter?
> Think: What kind of mindset do you have about different areas? Is there anything you believe you are "not naturally
> talented" at? Mindset often varies in different areas -- someone might have a fixed mindset with respect to artistic
> ability, but a growth mindset with respect to computing skill. Then, think about your learners. How might a learner's
> mindset about computational skill influence their learning in a workshop setting?
>
> Pair: Discuss your thoughts about the influence of mindset in a workshop. Try to come up with a few different ways or
> situations in which mindset might be relevant.
>
> Share: A few thoughts in the Etherpad (or go around the room and discuss)
>
> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.
{: .challenge}

If you recognize aspects of the fixed mindset in yourself, don't panic! Like everything else, a growth mindset can be learned. We're going to talk about some
strategies that will help you promote a growth mindset in your learners and yourself.

## Praise Influences Mindset

One specific way in which instructors can foster a growth mindset in learners
is in how we praise. [Carol Dweck's research](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/oct07/vol65/num02/The-Perils-and-Promises-of-Praise.aspx)
investigated three types of praise: performance-based, effort-based and improvement-based, and looked at how these
types of praise influence learner's mindsets.

We're most used to hearing **performance-based praise**. This sort of praise focuses on outcomes and implies that the
outcome (for example, getting a correct answer) is the most important part of the task. It is often (but not always)
combined with language that explicitly or implicitly supports the "intrinsic" model of competence. For example, "You
did a great job! You must be very smart."

**Effort-based praise** focuses on the learner's hard work. For example, "You did a good job, you must have worked very hard."
Exposing learners frequently to this type of praise helps them to transition from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset by
changing their perception of effort. For fixed-mindset people, if something doesn't come easy to you, it means that you
don't have natural ability and shouldn't bother. People with a growth mindset are much more likely to persevere in the face of challenge
and accomplish their goals.

**Improvement-based praise** is related to praise based on effort, but explicitly draws a learner's attention to the progress they've made.
For example, "You're doing so much better at this than last time, you must have worked very hard." This helps reinforce a growth-mindset by
highlighting our ability to improve with effort.

## Errors are Essential to Learning

> ## Typos
> The typos are the pedagogy.
> — Emily Jane McTavish
{: .testimonial}

Another example of how our beliefs (in this case, our emotions) impact learning
is in how we think about errors.  One of the barriers to learning is avoidance of making errors. Errors are associated with negative emotions, which leads to learners being
fearful of making them.

*Positive error framing* is the process of presenting errors as an integral part of the learning process and using them as teaching opportunities. Error framing encourages learners to understand that making errors provides valuable learning opportunities instead
of having negative consequences. For example, the [Language Acquisition Made Practical](http://www.worldcat.org/title/language-acquisition-made-practical-field-methods-for-language-learners/oclc/935845446?referer=di&ht=edition) (LAMP)
system for learning language encourages learners to develop phrases and try them in a variety of social situations with native speakers. By
being willing to make mistakes, LAMP learners receive useful feedback from native speakers in real-world social situations. Error framing has
shown to be useful in learning complex tasks such as programming. In one study, Steele-Johnson showed that error framing showed
[positive effects on metacognition and self-efficacy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617273).

How can we incorporate error framing into our lessons? We need to reduce the negative emotions associated with errors, instead casting errors
as a "[natural part of learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292881989_Enhancing_firm_performance_and_innovativeness_through_error_management_culture)".
Sharing experiences of learning from errors can encourage learners to adopt a growth-mindset. Associating improvement-based praise with errors
can also encourage positive emotions associated with making errors in learning. Finally, the use of
[participatory live coding]({{ page.root }}/14-live/) as the focus for teaching allows for instructors to model how errors can be positively
framed and the process for overcoming them.

> ## Helping Learners Learn From Mistakes (optional)
> A learner at your workshop asks for your help with an exercise and shows you their attempt at solving it. You see they've made an error
> that shows they misunderstand something fundamental about the lesson (for example, in the shell lesson, they forgot to put a space between
> `ls` and the name of the directory they are looking at). What would you say to the learner?
>
> In the Etherpad, describe the error your learner has made and how you would respond.

## Perseverance Predicts Success

Finally, have you ever thought about how the quality of persistence can
impact someone's learning?

Angela Duckworth, a Psychology professor from University of Pennsylvania, suggests that something called *grit* is an essential trait in
learning. Grit can be defined as [perseverance and passion in the face of difficulty towards a defined long term goal](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cvg1mbz0xrfx25l/DuckworthGross2014.pdf).
Learners with grit are willing to fail in their pursuit if they feel that it gets them closer to their goal. Learning and recovering
from failure is an essential skill in many fields. Learners with grit have shown to have a higher degree of success later on in
life. However, grit is not an innate trait; there is much evidence that suggests that grit is a trait that can be learned and instilled in
learners.

There are many ways we can help our learners attain grit.

- *Modeling resilience by sharing experiences of struggle*. Sharing your own experiences of having difficulty learning certain computing
concepts may help learners understand that the process of learning can be difficult. Sharing failures that were learning experiences may aid in
modeling resilience.
- *Promoting Perseverance*. Part of grit is being able to push through even when things are difficult. Improvement-based praise is an
important motivating tool to promote perseverance.
- *Sharing Passion*. Talking about why you persist in working in your field despite the difficulties and challenges is another way to instill
grit.
- *Emphasizing Long-Term Goals*. Showing the effects of learning the concepts in terms of learners' individual long-term goals can instill
passion and drive for learning despite the difficulties of the topic.

> ## How Are You Gritty? (Optional)
> A [previous exercise]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/08-motivation.md %}#overcoming-imposter-syndrome-optional) asked you to think of a time when learning something was difficult for you, or
> you made a mistake that seemed silly or embarrassing.
>
> How did you motivate yourself to continue learning? How did it feel to persist in the face of challenge?
> How do you feel now about your capabilities in this area?
>
> In the Etherpad, describe how you could use this story to illustrate the importance of grit for your learners.

> This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

## Habits of Lifelong Learners

Adopting beliefs and qualities like those listed above will help people become
lifelong learners. By helping learners develop the habits of lifelong learning,
we are not only preparing them to learn beyond the workshop, but hopefully,
contributing to their overall career success. Surviving the job market nowadays requires the ability
to be a lifelong learner, in order to learn and adapt to new skills that may
be required by employers. Many of these positions can be described as *Knowledge Work*, work that requires
["non-routine" problem solving](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/kpm.378). Knowledge workers need to be capable of what Cal
Newport calls "[deep work](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/)": defined as the "ability to focus intensely on cognitively
demanding tasks".

Lifelong learning arises from those who have the growth mindset. Both grit and
[curiosity](https://blog.udacity.com/2017/02/grit-yes-curiosity.html) have been identified as
[success factors in lifelong learning](https://www.enterrasolutions.com/lifelong-learners-embrace-curiosity-grit/).
Often, the process of learning is a difficult journey. By modeling "gritty" behavior and how it has helped us achieve
long-term goals, we can foster a "learn-it-all" rather than a "know-it-all" attitude in learners.

Emphasizing the role of [help-seeking behavior in the lifelong learning process](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Learning_theories_in_practice/Help-seeking)
is important, as it is a critical skill of lifelong learners. Encouraging learners to seek help can be difficult when societal norms view
seeking help as "stigmatizing, self-threatening behavior".
Because of this, we need to reframe help-seeking behavior as a
positive behavior to cope with difficulties. Part of this reframing can be modeled by instructors emphasizing that they are also lifelong learners
and by admitting the limits of their knowledge. Emphasizing that one's cohort is a powerful source of help is important to establishing a
positive learning community.

Establishing a safe space for learning is a combination
of many factors:

+ *Presenting the instructor as a learner*. Admitting that you don't know everything is part of showing that it is acceptable to make mistakes, and encouraging a growth mindset in learners (we'll talk much more about growth mindset in [a later lesson]({{ page.root }}/09-mindset/)). Using [participatory live coding]({{ page.root }}/14-live/), our chosen method for teaching concepts, is very useful for this reason. It is common to make errors while coding. When handled transparently, these errors can be very instructive for novice learners.
+ *Establishing norms for interaction*. This can be done by having, discussing, and enforcing a [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) or by having rules of interaction such as ensuring turn taking in discussions, possibly by passing around a talking stick, or by encouraging quieter people to contribute.
+ *Encouraging learners to learn from each other*. Acknowledge that some of the material can be difficult and that they will learn more working together. Asking more advanced learners to help beginner learners is a good way to maximize learning for both.
+ *Acknowledging when learners are confused.* Understanding why learners are confused provides useful feedback for instructors. We use formative assessments to pinpoint learners' misunderstandings. Acknowledging that their misunderstandings are valid is also key to encouraging a growth mindset.
