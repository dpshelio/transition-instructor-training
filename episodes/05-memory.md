In our final topic in how people learn (and therefore, how we can be more
effective instructors), we will be learning more about human memory:
specifically, how to remove unnecessary "load" in order to facilitate learning.

## Types of Memory

Learning involves memory. For our purposes, human memory can be divided into two different
layers.
The first is called *long-term*.
It is where we store persistent information like our friends' names and our home address.
It is essentially unbounded
(barring injury or disease, we will die before it fills up)
but it is slow to access.

Our second layer of memory is called *short-term*. This is the
type of memory you use to actively think about things and is often called working memory. It is much faster, but also much
smaller: in 1956, George Miller estimated that the average adult's short-term memory could hold
[7±2 items][wikipedia-7] for a few seconds before things started to drop out.
This is [why phone numbers are typically 7 or 8 digits long][phone-nums]:
back when phones had dials instead of keypads,
that was the longest sequence of numbers most adults could remember accurately
for as long as it took the dial to go around and around.

More recent research suggests that short-term memory is actually even smaller than this.
Regardless of its exact size, which may differ across people and contexts, we know that
short-term memory is limited. This has important implications for teaching. If we present
our learners with large amounts of information, without giving them the opportunity to
practice using it (and thereby transfer it into long-term memory), they will not retain
the material as well as if we present small amounts of information interspersed with
practice opportunities. This is yet another reason why going slowly and using
frequent formative assessment is important.

Most people will have found they only remember 5-7 words. Others may remember more! Those who do 
are almost invariably deploying a *memory management strategy*.

## Strategies For Memory Management

Because short-term memory is limited, we can support learners by not flooding their
short term memory with too many separate pieces of information. Does this mean we should 
teach fewer concepts? Well, yes, but this is not the only tool in our toolbox. 
We can also assist by providing strategies
and exercises to help them form the connections that will a) support them in holding more 
things in short-term memory at once and b) begin to move some concepts into
long-term memory.

### Chunking

Our minds can store larger numbers of facts in short-term memory by creating *chunks*, or
relationships among separate items, allowing them to be remembered as a single item.
For example, most of us will remember a word we read as a single item ("cat"), rather
than as a sequence of letters ("c-a-t").
Similarly, the pattern made by five spots on cards or die is remembered as a whole
rather than as five separate pieces of information.

{: .challenge}

Storing words in groups reduces the number of effective
items in your short-term memory, allowing you to keep
more information in your head at once. 

### Active Learning Through Formative Assessment

Formative assessment is a key component in helping learners solidify their understanding
and begin transferring ideas into long-term memory. The limitations of short-term 
memory are one reason why assessments should be frequent: to help learners engage 
with new concepts *before their short-term memory fills up* and starts ejecting things. 

Formative assessment will help learners to retain new information. However, it also sometimes 
asks them to integrate things they may have learned more than 7±2 ideas ago. The fact that a concept 
was previously taught at a workshop does not mean that it will automatically be available for 
use once its short-term memory window has expired. Be sure to remind learners of prior concepts 
essential to a task before 
asking them to rely upon it. 

### Limit concepts

In the same vein as "going slowly," it is important to limit the number of
concepts introduced in a lesson. This can be hard! As you are reviewing a lesson 
to teach, you will doubtless come across related concepts that are very useful, and 
you may feel strongly motivated to sneak them in. Keep in mind, however, that 
no matter how many exercises you do, *you 
cannot overcome the limits of short-term memory in a short-format workshop*. 
Planning your lesson with a concept map can help you 
not only identify key concepts and relationships, but also to notice when you are trying to 
teach too many things at once. 

## Why Guided Practice is Important

Memory is not the only cognitive resource that is limited. Attention is constrained as well. 
While many people believe that they can "multi-task," the reality is that attention can 
only focus on one thing at a time. Adding items that demand attention adds more things 
to alternate between attending to, which can reduce efficiency and performance on all of them.
the theory of *[cognitive load][wikipedia-cognitive-load]*.
There are different theories of cognitive load, but one by Sweller posits that people have to 
attend to three types of things when they are learning:

*   Things they have to think about in order to *perform a task* ("intrinsic load").
*   Mental effort required to *connect the task* to new and old information ("germane load").
*   *Distractions* and other mental effort not directly related to performing or learning from the task ("extraneous load").

Cognitive load is not always a bad thing! There is plenty of evidence that *some* difficulty is desirable 
and can increase learning. However, there are limits. Managing all forms of cognitive load, with particular 
attention to extraneous load, can help prevent *cognitive overload* from impeding learning altogether. 

One way to manage cognitive load as tasks become more complex is by using *guided practice*: 
creating a structure in which learners can
apply their skills in stepped, precisely targeted ways and get feedback on their progress before 
transferring their attention to a different element to be learned.

## Guided Practice at Work

How do we implement guided practice, lessening the burden of extraneous
cognitive load and allow people to focus on what is important?  There are
many different types of exercises that implement this guided practice; some
are listed in this [blog post by Greg Wilson][GW-exercise-post], including
Parson's Problems and labelling diagrams.

To learn more about a specific guided practice exercise
called *faded examples*, read on.

According to cognitive load theory,
searching for a solution strategy is an extra burden
on top of applying that strategy.
We can therefore accelerate learning
by giving learners worked examples that show them a problem and a detailed step-by-step solution,
followed by a series of faded examples.
The first of these presents a nearly-complete use of the same problem-solving strategy
with a small number of blanks for the learner to fill in.
The next problem is also of the same type,
but has more blanks,
and so on until the learner is asked to solve the entire problem.

Faded examples work because they introduce the problem-solving strategy piece by piece.
At each step,
learners have one new problem to tackle.
This is less intimidating than a blank screen or a blank sheet of paper.
It also encourages learners to think about the similarities and differences between various approaches,
which helps create the linkages in the mental model that instructors want them to form.

For example,
someone teaching Python might start by explaining this:

~~~
def total_length(words):
    """Returns the total length of all words in a list combined.

    Example:
       total_length(["red", "green", "blue"]) => 12
    """
    total = 0
    for word in words:
        total += len(word)
    return total
~~~
{: .python}

then ask learners to fill in the blanks in:

~~~
def word_lengths(words):
    """Returns a list of lengths of each word in a list.

    Example:
        word_lengths(["red", "green", "blue"]) => [3, 5, 4]
    """
    lengths = ____
    for word in words:
        lengths ____
    return lengths
~~~
{: .python}

The next problem might be:

~~~
def concatenate_all(words):
    """Combines all words in a list into one.

    Example:
        concatenate_all(["red", "green", "blue"]) => "redgreenblue"
    """
    result = ____
    for ____ in ____:
        ____
    return result
~~~~
{: .python}

and learners would finally be asked to tackle:

~~~
def acronymize(words):
    """Returns the first letter of each word in a list capitalised in a single string.

    Example:
        acronymize(["red", "green", "blue"]) => "RGB"
    """
    ____
~~~
{: .python}

Another situation in which a concept map can be helpful is in deciding where to place the
blanks in a faded example. Each blank (or set of blanks) would ideally correspond to one
concept in your concept map.

In the framework of cognitive load, some additional predictions can be made.

One example is work by Mayer and colleagues on
the *[split-attention effect][wikipedia-split-attention]*.
Linguistic and visual input are processed by different parts of the human brain,
and linguistic and visual memories are stored separately as well.
This means that correlating different linguistic, auditory, and visual
streams of information takes cognitive effort:
when someone reads one thing while hearing something else spoken aloud,
their brain cannot help but check that it is getting the same information on both channels.
Discrepancies between these channels increase cognitive load and decrease learning.
Learning is therefore more effective when information that is being presented simultaneously
in two different channels is redundant, rather than different.

For our workshops, this means the instructor should say out loud commands as they type them on the screen while engaging learners in [participatory live coding]({{ page.root }}/14-live/).

## Summary
The process of learning is constrained by the limits of short-term memory. In order to move
new information into long-term memory, it must be actively applied, but activities that
make excessive demands on short-term memory are likely to induce cognitive overload and can
easily harm learner motivation. Instructional tools that expand short-term memory by
increasing connectivity (chunking) among new concepts can improve
outcomes for subsequent memory-intensive exercises. Formative assessments, when performed
frequently, help learners by prompting them to apply new content before it has been
overwritten. Faded examples or other types of guided practice
both minimize demands on short-term memory and offer context that
helps improve connectivity for future work, in which the "scaffolding" of contextual support
can be gradually removed.
Anything you can do to a) recognize and b) support learners in working with the
limitations of short-term memory will improve the effectiveness of your teaching.
