questions:
- "How does inquiry-based learning perform compared to guided learning?"
- "What is cognitive load theory?"
- "What is the split-attention effect, and how should it affect the design of teaching materials?"
objectives:
- "Explain the basis and implications of cognitive load theory and critique it."
- "Construct faded examples for use as classroom exercises and explain the problem-solving strategies those examples illustrate."
keypoints:
- "Most adults can store 7Â±2 items in short-term memory for a few seconds before loss."  
- "Things seen together repeatedly are remembered (or mis-remembered) in chunks."  
- "Teaching consists of loading short-term memory and reinforcing it long enough for items to be transferred to long-term memory." 
- "Lesson episodes should not overload short-term memory."
- "Cognitive load theory predicts that focusing on one aspect at a time improves learning."

In our final topic in educational psychology, we'll be learning more about human memory:
specifically how to remove unnecessary "load" in order to facilitate learning.


## Faded Examples

According to cognitive load theory,
searching for a solution strategy is an extra burden
on top of applying that strategy.
We can therefore accelerate learning
by giving learners worked examples that show them a problem and a detailed step-by-step solution,
followed by a series of *faded examples*.
The first of these presents a nearly-complete use of the same problem-solving strategy just demonstrated
with a small number of blanks for the learner to fill in.
The next problem is also of the same type,
but has more blanks,
and so on until the learner is asked to solve the entire problem.

Faded examples work because they introduce the problem-solving strategy piece by piece.
At each step,
learners have one new problem to tackle.
This is less intimidating than a blank screen or a blank sheet of paper.
It also encourages learners to think about the similarities and differences between various approaches,
which helps create the linkages in the mental model that instructors want them to form.

For example,
someone teaching Python might start by explaining this:

~~~
# total_length(["red", "green", "blue"]) => 12
def total_length(words):
    total = 0
    for word in words:
        total += len(word)
    return total
~~~
{: .source}

then ask learners to fill in the blanks in:

~~~
# word_lengths(["red", "green", "blue"]) => [3, 5, 4]
def word_lengths(words):
    lengths = ____
    for word in words:
        lengths ____
    return lengths
~~~
{: .source}

The next problem might be:

~~~
# concatenate_all(["red", "green", "blue"]) => "redgreenblue"
def concatenate_all(words):
    result = ____
    for ____ in ____:
        ____
    return result
~~~~
{: .source}

and learners would finally be asked to tackle:

~~~
# acronymize(["red", "green", "blue"]) => "RGB"
def acronymize(words):
    ____
~~~
{: .source}

The key to constructing a good faded example is to think about the problem-solving strategy
or solution pattern that it is meant to teach.
For example,
the series of problems above illustrate the *accumulator pattern*,
in which the results of processing items from a collection
are repeatedly added to a single variable in some way
to create the final result.

> ## Create a Faded Example from a Lesson
>
> The following exercise should be done in groups of 2-3.
>
> 1.  Pick a block of code from an existing Software or Data Carpentry lesson,
>     or from another lesson you have taught recently.
> 2.  Replace 2-3 pieces of the code with a blank.
> 3.  Write a question to test the student's ability to correctly fill in that blank.
> 4.  Take 10 minutes for this exercise.
> 5.  Paste your faded example in the Etherpad.

## Concept Maps

Our tool of choice to represent an expert's knowledge graph is the *concept map*.
A concept map is simply a picture of someone's mental model of a domain:
facts are bubbles,
and connections are labelled arcs.
It is important that they are labelled:
saying "X and Y are related" is only helpful if we explain what the relationship *is*.
And yes,
one person's fact may be another person's connection,
but by *externalizing cognition*
(i.e., making thought processes and mental models visible),
concept maps help spark and focus discussion.

To show what concept maps look like,
consider this simple `for` loop in Python:

~~~
for ch in "abc":
    print(2*ch)
~~~
{: .source}

The three key concepts used in this loop are:

![Key Concepts](../fig/for-loop-concepts.png)

(In this case it's easy to connect the concepts to concrete elements in the program,
but that may not always be the case.)
The key relationships,
which are as important as the concepts themselves,
are:

![Relationships](../fig/for-loop-arcs.png)

A quick count shows that there are actually 6 things here,
not just 3,
so we're already brushing up against the limits of short-term memory.
If we add two more facts to show things that are usually (but not always) true:

![Recommendations](../fig/for-loop-rec.png)

the count rises to 8,
which is a good size for a single teaching episode.
A few other concept maps drawn by previous participants in this training course
are listed below:

* [Array Math](../fig/array-math.png)
* [Conditionals](../fig/conditionals.png)
* [Creating and Destroying Files](../fig/create-destroy.png)
* [Sets and Dictionaries in Python](../fig/dict-set.png)
* [Input and Output](../fig/io.png)
* [Lists and Loops](../fig/lists-loops.png)

Most of these are larger than our recommended limit,
but that's not necessarily a bad thing:
after drawing a concept map for an entire subject,
a lesson designer can then carve out tightly-connected sub-graphs to make individual episodes.

Concept maps can be used in many ways:

1.  To aid solo design of a lesson by helping authors figure out what they're trying to teach.
    Crucially, a concept map separates content from order:
    in our experience,
    people rarely wind up teaching things in the order in which they first drew them.
2.  They aid communication with fellow lesson designers.
    Instructors with very different ideas of what they're trying to teach
    are likely to pull their learners in different directions.
    Drawing and sharing concept maps isn't guaranteed to prevent this,
    but it certainly helps.
3.  Concept maps also aid communication with learners.
    While it's possible to give learners a pre-drawn map at the start of a lesson for them to annotate,
    it's better to draw it piece by piece while teaching
    to reinforce the ties between what's in the map and what the instructor said.
    (We will return to this idea below when discussing Mayer's work on multimedia learning.)
4.  Concept maps are also a useful formative assessment technique:
    having learners draw concept maps of what they think they just heard shows the instructor
    what was missed and what was mis-understood.
    Reviewing the learners' concept maps is too time-consuming for use in workshops,
    but very useful in weekly lectures
    *once learners are familiar with the technique*:
    as [Glass observed][amazon-glass],
    any new tool or technique initially slows people down.

Concept maps are also useful for many other kinds of tasks.
For example,
the next time you have a team meeting,
give everyone a sheet of paper
and have them spend a few minutes drawing a concept map of
the project you're all working on---separately.
On the count of three,
have everyone reveal their concept maps simultaneously.
The discussion that follows everyone's realization
of how different their mental models of the project's aims and organization are
is always interesting...

Concept maps are also a useful way to organize one's thoughts
before putting together a talk or writing a paper.
As with lessons,
they allow us to *externalize cognition*,
i.e.,
to get our thoughts out where we can see them
(and see the contradictions that have happily been swimming around inside our heads
without bumping into each other).

> Trade with a partner, and critique each other's maps.
> Do they present concepts or surface detail?
> Which of the relationships in your partner's map do you consider concepts and vice versa?
>
> Take 10 minutes to draw the concept maps and share with your neighbor. 
> Write "*done*" in the chat once you have finished.

>
> Concept maps can be used as a classroom discussion exercise.
> Put learners in small groups (2-4 people each),
> give each group some sticky notes on which a few key concepts are written,
> and have them build a concept map on a whiteboard by placing those sticky notes,
> connecting them with labelled arcs,
> and adding any other concepts they think they need.
