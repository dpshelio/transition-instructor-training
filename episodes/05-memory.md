In our final topic in how people learn (and therefore, how we can be more
effective instructors), we will be learning more about human memory:
specifically, how to remove unnecessary "load" in order to facilitate learning.

## Types of Memory

Learning involves memory. For our purposes, human memory can be divided into two different
layers.
The first is called *long-term*.
It is where we store persistent information like our friends' names and our home address.
It is essentially unbounded
(barring injury or disease, we will die before it fills up)
but it is slow to access.

Our second layer of memory is called *short-term*. This is the
type of memory you use to actively think about things and is often called working memory. It is much faster, but also much
smaller: in 1956, George Miller estimated that the average adult's short-term memory could hold
[7Â±2 items][wikipedia-7] for a few seconds before things started to drop out.
This is why phone numbers are typically 7 or 8 digits long:
back when phones had dials instead of keypads,
that was the longest sequence of numbers most adults could remember accurately
for as long as it took the dial to go around and around.

More recent research suggests that short-term memory is actually even smaller than this.
Regardless of its exact size, which may differ across people and contexts, we know that
short-term memory is limited. This has important implications for teaching. If we present
our learners with large amounts of information, without giving them the opportunity to
practice using it (and thereby transfer it into long-term memory), they will not retain
the material as well as if we present small amounts of information interspersed with
practice opportunities. This is yet another reason why going slowly and using
frequent formative assessment is important.

Most people will have found they only remember 5-7 words. Others may remember more! Those who do 
are almost invariably deploying a *memory management strategy*.

## Strategies For Memory Management

Because short-term memory is limited, we can support learners by not flooding their
short term memory with too many separate pieces of information. Does this mean we should 
teach fewer concepts? Yes! However, this is not the only tool in our toolbox. 
We can also assist by providing strategies
and exercises to help them form the connections that will a) support them in holding more 
things in short-term memory at once and b) begin to *consolidate* some concepts, moving them into
long-term memory.

### Chunking

Our minds can store larger numbers of facts in short-term memory by creating *chunks*, or
relationships among separate items, allowing them to be remembered as a single item.
For example, most of us will remember a word we read as a single item ("cat"), rather
than as a sequence of letters ("c-a-t").
Similarly, the pattern made by five spots on cards or die is remembered as a whole
rather than as five separate pieces of information.

Associating concepts 
reduces the number of effective
items in your short-term memory, allowing you to keep
more information in your head at once. 

You may have come across other mnemonic strategies, including some that rely on imagining a 
"place" association for each item, e.g. a "memory palace." While slightly different from 
chunking, this is another example of how 
*connecting* information can make it easier to remember.

### Active Learning Through Formative Assessment

Formative assessment is a key component in helping learners solidify their understanding
and begin transferring ideas into long-term memory. The limitations of short-term 
memory are one reason why assessments should be frequent: short-term memory is limited not only in 
space, but also in time. As items begin to be consolidated into long-term memory, they also 
become more consistently accessible for application during the workshop.

Formative assessment will help learners to retain new information. However, it also sometimes 
asks them to integrate things they may have already forgotten. The fact that a concept 
was previously taught at a workshop does not mean that it will automatically be available for 
use once its (very brief!) short-term memory window has expired. Be sure to remind learners of prior concepts 
essential to a task. 

### Limit concepts

In the same vein as "going slowly," it is important to limit the number of
concepts introduced in a lesson. This can be hard! As you are reviewing a lesson 
to teach, you will doubtless come across related concepts that are very useful, and 
you may feel strongly motivated to sneak them in. 
Planning your lesson with a concept map can help you 
not only identify key concepts and relationships, but also to notice when you are trying to 
teach too many things at once. 

### Group Work

_Elaboration_, or explaining your work, supports transfer 
to long-term memory. This is one reason why *teaching* is one of the most effective ways to learn! 
Group work can feel uncomfortable at first and consumes time in a workshop, but 
learners often rate group work as a high point for both enjoyment and learning in a workshop. 
This is also a great opportunity for helpers 
to circulate and address lingering questions or engage with more advanced discussions.

### Opportunities for Reflection

Reflection is another tool that can help learners review things they have 
learned, strengthen connections between them, and consolidate long-term memories. Like 
formative assessment, asking 
learners for feedback can double as both a source of information and an effective consolidating 
prompt, as providing feedback demands some reflection on what has been learned. We will talk 
more about methods for this in the next section. You may also wish to pause 
and allow learners to write summary notes for themselves or otherwise ask them to review 
what they have learned at various points in the workshop.


## Attention is a Limited Resource

Memory is not the only cognitive resource that is limited. Attention is constrained as well. 
While many people believe that they can "multi-task," the reality is that attention can 
only focus on one thing at a time. Adding items that demand attention adds more things 
to alternate between attending to, which can reduce efficiency and performance on all of them.
the theory of *[cognitive load][wikipedia-cognitive-load]*.
There are different theories of cognitive load, but one by Sweller posits that people have to 
attend to three types of things when they are learning:

*   Things they have to think about in order to *perform a task* ("intrinsic").
*   Mental effort required to *connect the task* to new and old information ("germane").
*   *Distractions* and other mental effort not directly related to performing or learning from the task ("extraneous").

Cognitive load is not always a bad thing! There is plenty of evidence that *some* difficulty is desirable 
and can increase learning. However, there are limits. Managing all forms of cognitive load, with particular 
attention to extraneous load, can help prevent *cognitive overload* from impeding learning altogether. 

One way to manage cognitive load as tasks become more complex is by using *guided practice*: 
creating a structure in which learners can
apply their skills in stepped, precisely targeted ways and get feedback on their progress before 
transferring their attention to a different element to be learned.

## Attention Management in Your Workshop
Broadly, guided practice means providing structure for learners that asks them to 
actively engage with practice in manageable increments. This stands in contrast, for 
example, with a "lecture/lab" type arrangement, in which learners may be expected to apply 
everything they have learned in a long lecture to implement a complex lab exercise. 

The Carpentries approach to instruction uses participatory live coding, a technique we will discuss 
in more detail tomorrow. Carpentries lessons generally contain small tasks arranged incrementally 
which may be completed together, with interspersed challenges asking learners to accomplish a small number of things 
based on limited prior knowledge. 

You have many choices in how you use these curriculum materials, including exercises that may be added 
for practice or formative assessment, decisions to work in groups or pairs, and choices about what to 
display for learners while they work. We will briefly consider the implications in each case for memory, 
attention, and learning.

### Creating Exercises

There are
many different types of exercises that are compatible with guided practice. Carefully targeted multiple 
choice questions can play this role. A few more that you may wish to consider are:
* Faded examples: fill-in-the-blank programming blocks
* Parson's Problems: out-of-order code sorting challenges
* Labelling diagrams or flow charts (may also be organized as a fill-in-the-blank)

For more on computational exercises, see this [blog post by Greg Wilson][GW-exercise-post].

### What to Display

The Carpentries provides nicely formatted curricula for teaching. However, you may have noticed that you have not seen much, or perhaps 
any of the Instructor Training curriculum during your time as a learner in this workshop. In most situations **we do not recommend 
displaying Carpentries curriculum materials** to your learners while you teach. 

The visual environment in a workshop should be focused on exactly what you are teaching and should mirror, 
as closely as possible, exactly what you say. 
This is because keeping track of distracting and contradictory sensory information adds to cognitive load. 
The *[split-attention effect][wikipedia-split-attention]* describes the cognitive effort involved with 
trying to assemble information from different modalities. Learning is most effective when visual 
displays, text, and auditory information presented together
are the same, with minimal distractions. 

For Carpentries workshops, this is why we ask Instructors to **speak commands as they type them on the screen** 
while engaging learners in [participatory live coding]({{ page.root }}/14-live/).

One thing you may wish to consider adding to your (otherwise minimalist) visual environment, however, is a **running glossary of commands** 
and other key terms. This can be maintained by a helper on a white board or an easel pad and will help learners readily access 
items that may have already been dropped from short-term memory by the time they need them. In an online workshop, display of a glossary 
is impractical because of severe limitations on screen space; however, a glossary can still be maintained in a collaborative document 
for reference as needed.


## Summary
The process of learning is constrained by the limits of short-term memory. In order to move
new information into long-term memory, it must be actively applied, but activities that
make excessive demands on short-term memory are likely to induce cognitive overload and can
easily harm learner motivation. Instructional tools that expand short-term memory by
increasing connectivity (chunking) among new concepts can improve
outcomes for subsequent memory-intensive exercises. Formative assessments, when performed
frequently, help learners by prompting them to apply new content before it has been
overwritten. Faded examples or other types of guided practice
both minimize demands on short-term memory and offer context that
helps improve connectivity for future work, in which the "scaffolding" of contextual support
can be gradually removed.
Anything you can do to a) recognize and b) support learners in working with the
limitations of short-term memory will improve the effectiveness of your teaching.
