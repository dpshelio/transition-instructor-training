In becoming a certified [Carpentries Instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/),
you are also becoming part of a community of like-minded volunteers. Our most
active members draw upon this community for support and mentorship, pursuing goals that
matter to them and creating relationships across the globe.
This section provides some background on
[The Carpentries]({{ site.carpentries_site }}) organization, how we are structured, and a few
ways you might wish to participate (including by teaching workshops!).

## A Brief History


[Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) was founded in 1998 with the mission of teaching lab skills for research computing.
[Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}) was founded in 2014 with the mission of building communities teaching universal data literacy.

Also in 2014, [Library Carpentry]({{ site.lc_site }}) was founded with the mission of teaching data skills to people working in library- and information-related roles.

On January 1, 2018, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry merged
their projects to form a new project called
[The Carpentries]({{ site.carpentries_site }})
under the fiscal sponsorship of
[Community Initiatives][CI].
Within this new organization structure, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry retained their individual identities as Lesson Programs of The Carpentries.
On November 1, 2018, The Carpentries Executive Council
approved [Library Carpentry]({{ site.lc_site }})
as the third official Lesson Program of The Carpentries.

The Carpentries administration and other essential operations are held together by a small [Core Team][coreteam_page], 
but many of our proudest accomplishments are achieved through the efforts of volunteer participants in our global and local communities.
Global Carpentries communities consist of Instructors, Instructor Trainers, Maintainers, Lesson Developers, Institutional Partners, committee and council 
members, and other supporters who participate, synchronously or asynchronously, in building our programs for all to share. At the local level, individual 
Carpentries communities may include many participants who  are not necessarily connected with or even aware of our global activities, including helpers, 
learners, faculty sponsors, and others who contribute to keep communities thriving and growing 'on the ground.'

![A very brief history of The Carpentries. A timeline - 1998 Software Carpentry is founded by Greg Wilson and Bret Gorda to teach researchers better software development skills. 2005 lesson materials are made open source with support from the Python Software Foundation. 2012 Software Carpentry workshop efforts scale with support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Mozila Science Lab. 2013 the first Software Carpentry for Librarians workshops are organized in the US and Canada. 2014 Data Carpentry is founded by Karen Cranston, Hilmar Lapp, Tracy Teal, and Ethan White with support from the National Science Foundation. James Baker receives support from the Software Sustainability Institute to develop and implement Library Carpentry. Software Carpentry Foundation is founded under the auspices of NumFOCUS. 2015 - Data Carpentry workshop efforts scaled with support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. 2018 in January, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry merge to form The Carpentries, a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives. In November, Library Carpentry joins as a Lesson Program.](../fig/SWCDChistory.png)

You can learn more about the history and goals of each Lesson Program by reading
"[Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned][F1000]",
"[Data Carpentry: Workshops to Increase Data Literacy for Researchers][IJDC]" and
"[Library Carpentry: software skills training for library professionals][LIBERQ]"".

## Similarities and Differences between The Carpentries Lesson Programs

All lesson programs under The Carpentries share the same value
of promoting efficient, shareable, and reproducible research practices.
Their aligned missions are accomplished by running accessible, inclusive training workshops; teaching openly available, high-quality, community-developed lessons; and fostering an active, inclusive, diverse instructor community that promotes and models reproducible research as a community norm.

Similarities between Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry workshops include:
*   a focus on technical skills,
*   a two-day format taught by volunteer instructors, and
*   a focus on filling gaps in current training for learners.

The major differences between Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry workshops
are their content and intended audience. Their similarities and differences are depicted in this diagram:


![Three intersecting circles labelled Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry. Software and Data Carpentry both focus on research focused computational skills. Data and Library Carpentry are both domain targeted. Software and Library Carpentry both have modular a curriculum. All three Lesson Programs provide novice-level training, two-day workshops to address gaps in computational skills, taught by volunteer instructors applying Carpentries teaching practices.](../fig/carpentries-venn-diagram_20200904.svg)


## What is a Carpentries Workshop? The Rules.

### Using the Names and Logos

The names "Data Carpentry", "Library Carpentry", and "Software Carpentry"
and their respective logos
are all trademarked.
You may only call a workshop a Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, or Software Carpentry workshop if:

*   it covers the core curriculum for that lesson program (see below),
*   at least one of the instructors is a certified Carpentries Instructor,
*   you run our standardized pre- and post-workshop assessments and ensure everyone participates.

Note that as long as you have at least one certified Instructor, the other
instructors and helpers at a branded workshop do not have to be certified. We
rely on your judgement as a certified Instructor to recruit and orient volunteers who
will support you in implementing The Carpentries ethos and practices. **We do expect you to have at least one co-Instructor and helpers**, even if they are not 
certified instructors.

> ## Local Support
>
> There is a helpful list for planning here in the handbook [Helper Checklist and Suggestions][docs-helper-checklist].

### Materials

All Carpentries lesson
materials are freely available under a permissive [open license]({{ page.root }}{% link LICENSE.md %}).
This means that you may use them in contexts outside of a Carpentries workshop (e.g. as material
introduced into a longer course, as a standalone 2-3 hour session, as homework exercises, etc.)
provided you cite the original source.

It is only when you want to run a branded Carpentries workshop using the materials
that the requirements listed above are needed. Other workshops may be described as being "Carpentries-based", using Carpentries materials, etc.

### What is the Core Curriculum?

For Data Carpentry:
* a Data Carpentry [lesson][dc-lessons]
on data organization and 
* three
other modules in the same domain from the Data Carpentry curriculum
Published curricula include the Ecology, Genomics, Social Science and Geospatial workshop materials. Other domains are in development, including Image 
Processing, Economics, and Astronomy.

For Library Carpentry:
* three to four of the
[core lessons][lc-lessons], which include an introduction to data, the UNIX shell, OpenRefine, and Git
Library Carpentry also maintains an "extended" set of lessons
that can be taught in addition to the core curriculum
These lessons are taught infrequently or are under development and include:
SQL, webscraping, Python and an introduction to data for archivists.

For Software Carpentry:
* [lessons][swc-lessons]
on version control (e.g. Git)
* the UNIX shell,
and 
* a programming language (e.g. R or Python)

Within these guidelines, there is flexibility in which episodes of the lesson you cover,
which exercises you use, and whether you include optional materials (e.g. callouts) and
optional episodes.

### Instructor Badges Apply Universally

Certified Carpentries Instructors can teach curricula for any of the lesson programs
(Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentries)
as they feel able. Instructor badges
may list a primary lesson program affiliation, but Instructors are **not** required to certify separately for each. For more
information, see the description of [the Instructor checkout procedure]({{ page.root }}/checkout/).



## How to Run a Carpentries Workshop

[**The Carpentries Handbook**][docs] is a community-developed resource that
provides tips, checklists, and points of contact for nearly all Carpentries-related activities in one location.
The Carpentries Handbook is the definitive source for policies and information.
Here, we will cover some information about actually running a workshop.

Briefly, there are two types of Carpentries workshops: **centrally-organized** and
**self-organized**. Centrally-organized workshops include support from
[Regional Coordinators][rcs-page] and our workshop administration team.
The Carpentries team will:
- recruit Instructors to teach
- manage workshop registration
- coordinate communication between Instructors and Hosts
- provide links to pre- and post- workshop survey data to Instructors and Hosts. (Note that the links to the surveys themselves are generated by the workshop website)

Centrally organized workshops *do not* include:
- travel arrangements or expense management
- recruitment of helpers (we recommend 1 per 8-10 learners)
- creation of a workshop website
- communication with learners before or after a workshop
- local logistics (e.g. catering)

These must be arranged by the Host. Local instructors will be prioritized for selection, and constraints on recruitment may also be noted in the request form. 

For self-organized workshops, the host institution is responsible for all logistics and administration. However, if a self-organized workshop request form is 
submitted, The Carpentries will send links to the pre- and post- workshop survey response data to all identified Instructors and Hosts. You can also ask us, or 
reach out on our community channels, for advice! 

To request a centrally-organised workshop, register a self-organised workshop, or ask for more information on either, your [start page is here][workshops-form]. Be sure to submit your request in time to make use of those pre-workshop survey data!

> ## Teaching Opportunities
>
> Many Instructors aim to teach within a local community and do not want to travel. In that case,
> you will coordinate with your community to gain access to teaching opportunities.
>
> If you want to be presented with opportunities to teach outside your community -- locally or far from home, be sure to join our Instructor
> mailing list during the community exercise below. This is how we recruit Instructors to teach in centrally-organized workshops around the world.
>
> The Carpentries cannot not guarantee
> that all Instructors who respond to recruitment calls will be selected, and depending on your area these opportunities may be scarce.
> If you want to get started right away, consider organizing
> your own workshop or even teaching a single lesson with a few friends. If your friends have not been through Instructor Training, 
> consider sharing a 'crash course' to help them understand how best to support your efforts.
{: .callout}

More information is available on [our website][workshops-page]. Finer details, 
template emails, and checklists for Hosts, Instructors, and Helpers are available in [The Carpentries Handbook: Teaching and Hosting][docs-teach-host]

Our Handbook also details [policies][docs-policies], many of which affect Instructors and workshops. In particular, 
be sure to read through the [instructor no-show policy][docs-noshow] before signing up for your first workshop.


> ## Explain to a partner
>
> With a partner, take turns asking and answering the question: "I want to organize a workshop! What will I need to do?" One partner should ask about a 
> self-organized workshop, and the other can ask about a centrally-organized workshop. If you have a third person, they can help out the answerer if there is 
> something they can't explain. 
> 
> If you encounter new questions during this process, be sure to write them in the Etherpad.
>
> Leave about 10 minutes for this discussion.

## A Culture of Contribution

In the same way that we hope to promote a
culture of openness, sharing,
and reproducibility in science and research through training researchers with
the tools they need, The
Carpentries community aims to be open, collaborative, and
based on best practices. We draw together the collective expertise of
all who teach with us to collaborate on new lessons, share related resources,
and maintain our lessons with "bug fixes" and improvements as we go. None of what we offer is possible
without our contributing community! We hope you will join in, and take pride in doing so.
Our [Help Wanted page][help-wanted] lists issues for which lesson maintainers need assistance
and is a good place to start when looking for ways to contribute.

> ## Setting Out On Your Own... Together: Lesson Incubation
>
> Maybe this instructor training has inspired you to go home and write your
> own fantastic lesson!  If you would like to model it after the Software, Data and
> Library Carpentry lesson format, you can find a template and instructions in
> [The Carpentries lesson example repository]({{ site.example_repo }}),
> and a place to develop it in [The Carpentries Incubator][carpentries-incubator].
>
> Any lesson that uses The Carpentries [lesson template][lesson-template],
> follows our [Code of Conduct][coc], and is licensed either [CC-BY][cc-by] or [CC-0][cc-0]
> can be hosted in The Carpentries Incubator.
> Another resource, [The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook][cdh], provides a guide to
> the backwards design approach we recommend for lesson development.
{: .callout}

> ## Help Wanted: Breaking Down Barriers
>
> At The Carpentries, we know all too well that tools and technical procedures can present a serious barrier to progress. 
> That is why we exist! So we appreciate the irony when participation in our community demands tools or technical 
> procedures that may not be familiar or accessible to all who wish to contribute. GitHub, in particular is often recognized as an obstacle;
> this is something our community has [discussed extensively][git-blog].
>
> We are actively invested in making our processes as friendly and inclusive as possible, and that includes supporting our 
> community in surmounting the barriers presented by our own technologies of choice. Watch our channels for 
> opportunities to develop your skills as a contributor! In the mean time, if you
> have any ideas about how we can make our resources more contributor-friendly,
> please [let us know][contact-page].
{: .callout}


### Community Roles

The Carpentries is a complex, global community teaching workshops and developing lessons are only two examples of many ways to participate! 
Whatever your interests or strengths, we hope you will find a place where you can grow with us. 

> ## Who Does What
> 
> Have a look at this form to match different Carpentries roles with short descriptions. If you are not sure about some of them or if you want to know more,
