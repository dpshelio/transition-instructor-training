In becoming a certified [Carpentries Instructor](https://carpentries.org/instructors/),
you are also becoming part of a community of like-minded volunteers. Our most
active members draw upon this community for support and mentorship, pursuing goals that
matter to them and creating relationships across the globe.
This section provides some background on
[The Carpentries]({{ site.carpentries_site }}) organization, how we are structured, and a few
ways you might wish to participate (including by teaching workshops!).

## A Brief History


[Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) was founded in 1998 with the mission of teaching lab skills for research computing.
[Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}) was founded in 2014 with the mission of building communities teaching universal data literacy.

Also in 2014, [Library Carpentry]({{ site.lc_site }}) was founded with the mission of teaching data skills to people working in library- and information-related roles.

On January 1, 2018, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry merged
their projects to form a new project called
[The Carpentries]({{ site.carpentries_site }})
under the fiscal sponsorship of
[Community Initiatives](https://communityin.org/).
Within this new organization structure, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry retained their individual identities as Lesson Programs of The Carpentries.
On November 1, 2018, The Carpentries Executive Council
approved [Library Carpentry]({{ site.lc_site }})
as the third official Lesson Program of The Carpentries.

The Carpentries core operations are run by a small Core Team, but the heart of the project consists of our global and local communities. Global Carpentries communities consist of Instructors, Instructor Trainers,
Maintainers, Lesson Developers, Institutional Partners, committee and council members, and other supporters who participate, synchronously or asynchronously, in building our programs for all to share. At the local level, individual Carpentries communities may include many participants who 
are not necessarily connected with or even aware of our global activities, including helpers, learners, faculty sponsors, and others who contribute to keep 
communities thriving and growing 'on the ground.'

![A very brief history of The Carpentries. A timeline - 1998 Software Carpentry is founded by Greg Wilson and Bret Gorda to teach researchers better software development skills. 2005 lesson materials are made open source with support from the Python Software Foundation. 2012 Software Carpentry workshop efforts scale with support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Mozila Science Lab. 2013 the first Software Carpentry for Librarians workshops are organized in the US and Canada. 2014 Data Carpentry is founded by Karen Cranston, Hilmar Lapp, Tracy Teal, and Ethan White with support from the National Science Foundation. James Baker receives support from the Software Sustainability Institute to develop and implement Library Carpentry. Software Carpentry Foundation is founded under the auspices of NumFOCUS. 2015 - Data Carpentry workshop efforts scaled with support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. 2018 in January, Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry merge to form The Carpentries, a fiscally sponsored project of Community Initiatives. In November, Library Carpentry joins as a Lesson Program.](../fig/SWCDChistory.png)

You can learn more about the history and goals of each Lesson Program by reading
"[Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned](https://f1000research.com/articles/3-62/v2)",
"[Data Carpentry: Workshops to Increase Data Literacy for Researchers](http://ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/10.1.135)" and
"[Library Carpentry: software skills training for library professionals](https://www.liberquarterly.eu/article/10.18352/lq.10176/)"".

## Similarities and Differences between The Carpentries Lesson Programs

All lesson programs under The Carpentries share the same value
of promoting efficient, shareable, and reproducible research practices.
Their aligned missions are accomplished by running accessible, inclusive training workshops; teaching openly available, high-quality, community-developed lessons; and fostering an active, inclusive, diverse instructor community that promotes and models reproducible research as a community norm.

Similarities between Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry workshops include:
*   a focus on technical skills.
*   a two-day format taught by volunteer instructors.
*   a focus on filling gaps in current training for learners.

The major differences between Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentry workshops
are their content and intended audience. Their similarities and differences are depicted in this diagram:

![Three intersecting circles labelled Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and Library Carpentry. Software and Data Carpentry both focus on research focused computational skills. Data and Library Carpentry are both domain targeted. Software and Library Carpentry both have modular a curriculum. All three Lesson Programs provide novice-level training, two-day workshops to address gaps in computational skills, taught by volunteer instructors applying Carpentries teaching practices.](../fig/carpentries-venn-diagram_20200904.svg)


## What is a Carpentries Workshop? The Rules.

### Using the Names and Logos

The names "Data Carpentry", "Library Carpentry", and "Software Carpentry"
and their respective logos
are all trademarked.
You may only call a workshop a Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, or Software Carpentry workshop if:

*   it covers the core curriculum for that lesson program (see below),
*   at least one of the instructors is a certified Carpentries Instructor,
*   you run our standardized pre- and post-workshop assessments and ensure everyone participates.

Note that as long as you have at least one certified Instructor, the other
instructors and helpers at a branded workshop do not have to be certified. We
rely on your judgement as a certified Instructor to recruit and orient volunteers who
will support you in implementing The Carpentries ethos and practices. **We do expect you to have at least one co-Instructor and helpers**, even if they are not 
certified instructors.

> ## Local Support
>
> There is a great list here in the handbook [Helper Checklist and Suggestions](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html#helper-checklist).
{: .callout}

### Materials

All Carpentries lesson
materials are freely available under a permissive [open license]({{ page.root }}{% link LICENSE.md %}).
This means that you may use them in contexts outside of a Carpentries workshop (e.g. as material
introduced into a longer course, as a standalone 2-3 hour session, as homework exercises, etc.)
provided you cite the original source.

It is only when you want to run a branded Carpentries workshop using the materials
that the requirements listed above are needed. Other workshops may be described as being "Carpentries-based", using Carpentries materials, etc.

### What is the Core Curriculum?

For Data Carpentry:
* a Data Carpentry [lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/)
on data organization and 
* three
other modules in the same domain from the Data Carpentry curriculum
Published curricula include the Ecology, Genomics, Social Science and Geospatial workshop materials. Other domains are in development, including Image 
Processing, Economics, and Astronomy.

For Library Carpentry:
* three to four of the
[core lessons](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/#core-curriculum), which include an introduction to data, the UNIX shell, OpenRefine, and Git
Library Carpentry also maintains an "extended" set of lessons
that can be taught in addition to the core curriculum
These lessons are taught infrequently or are under development and include:
SQL, webscraping, Python and an introduction to data for archivists.

For Software Carpentry:
* [lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/index.html)
on version control (e.g. Git)
* the UNIX shell,
and 
* a programming language (e.g. R or Python)

Within these guidelines, there is flexibility in which episodes of the lesson you cover,
which exercises you use, and whether you include optional materials (e.g. callouts) and
optional episodes.

### Instructor Badges Apply Universally

Certified Carpentries Instructors can teach curricula for any of the lesson programs
(Data Carpentry, Library Carpentry, and Software Carpentries)
as they feel able. Instructor badges
may list a primary lesson program affiliation, but Instructors are **not** required to certify separately for each. For more
information, see the description of [the Instructor checkout procedure]({{ page.root }}/checkout/).



## How to Run a Carpentries Workshop

[**The Carpentries Handbook**](https://docs.carpentries.org/) is a community-developed resource that
provides tips, checklists, and points of contact for nearly all Carpentries-related activities in one location.
The Carpentries Handbook is the definitive source for policies and information.
Here, we will cover some information about actually running a workshop.

Briefly, there are two types of Carpentries workshops: centrally-organized and
self-organized. Centrally-organized workshops are organized by a team of
[Regional Coordinators](https://carpentries.org/regionalcoordinators/) who take care of logistics and administration such as
finding instructors and handling workshop registration. For self-organized
workshops, the organization hosting the event is responsible for these details.

> ## Workshops as an Instructor
>
> As an Instructor, you may be primarily teaching at local workshops or you
> may not have local opportunities, or you may just want to
> teach somewhere else.
>
> If you want to teach non-locally, you should be sure to join our Instructor
> mailing list during the community exercise below, so that you hear about
> upcoming teaching opportunities.
>
> Note that The Carpentries does not guarantee
> that instructors will get to teach at workshops after they are trained, so the
> best way to make sure that you get to teach (if you want) is to try running
> a workshop or even a single lesson yourself. It can seem daunting to organize
> your own workshop, but as long as you have 1-2 people who can either help or
> co-instruct, The Carpentries Core Team and community can provide
> support and guidance so that it is not so scary!
{: .callout}

In both cases (self- or centrally-organized), you can start the workshop
process by completing [The Carpentries workshop request form](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/workshop/).

For more details on how to run each type of workshop, see:
* [The Carpentries Handbook: Teaching and Hosting](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html)

or the the following Lesson Program specific references:
* [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops-host/)
* [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org/workshops/)
* [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request/) workshop pages.

Policies related to Instructor Training and workshops The Carpentries can be found in [The Carpentries Handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/index.html). Please
be sure to read through the [instructor no-show policy](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/instructor-no-show-policy.html#instructor-no-show-policy) before signing up for your first workshop.



> ## Question and Answer
>
> What questions do you have about running and teaching at a workshop? Talk with a partner and
> enter your questions into the Etherpad. At this time we will also return to discuss questions remaining from the beginning of the day.
>
> Leave about 10 minutes for this discussion.

## A Culture of Contribution

In the same way that we hope to promote a
culture of openness, sharing,
and reproducibility in science and research through training researchers with
the tools they need, The
Carpentries organization itself aims to be open, collaborative, and
based on best practices.  We want to draw together the collective expertise of
our teaching community to create collaborative lessons, share other materials,
and improve the lessons via "bug fixes" as we go along.
Our [Help Wanted page][help-wanted] lists issues for which lesson maintainers need assistance
and is a good place to start when looking for ways to contribute.

> ## Lesson Incubation
>
> Maybe this instructor training has inspired you to go home and write your
> own fantastic lesson!  If you would like to model it after the Software, Data and
> Library Carpentry lesson format, you can find a template and instructions in
> [The Carpentries lesson example repository]({{ site.example_repo }}),
> and a place to develop it in [The Carpentries Incubator][carpentries-incubator].
>
> Any lesson that uses The Carpentries [lesson template][lesson-template],
> follows our [Code of Conduct][coc], and is licensed either [CC-BY][cc-by] or [CC-0][cc-0]
> can be hosted in The Carpentries Incubator.
> Another resource, [The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook][cdh], provides a guide to
> the backwards design approach we recommend for lesson development.
{: .callout}

> ## Many Ways to Contribute
>
> We recognize that the medium of GitHub may be restrictive to those
> who wish to contribute to our lessons.  We are always searching for
> ways to make the process more friendly to all, whether that be
> contribution training, or alternative routes to contribution.  If you
> have any ideas how we might make contribution more contributor-friendly,
> please let us know.
{: .callout}

Being part of a friendly, open discussion, is of equal or greater importance
to the community than submitting the perfect lesson change.  The
[checkout process]({{ page.root }}/checkout/) to become a certified Instructor will be
one way to start connecting to the community and find which area will allow you
to contribute best.

## The Carpentries Community

As you can imagine, based on the above, there are many aspects of running The Carpentries!
While there are a small number of dedicated Core Team members who work for The Carpentries organization,
the real power of The Carpentries is in its community of volunteers that take on all sorts of
roles to teach and organize workshops, help produce and maintain lessons, and most importantly,
build local and global communities of practice around  skills for data analysis, computational thinking, and research software development. Our community depends on individuals like you who are passionate about expanding these communities of practice through inclusive and evidence-based instructional practices, and can contribute your perspective and expertise to continually refine our instructional materials and practices.  A full description of the breadth and diversity of community member roles, an overview of The Carpentries various social media channels, a calendar of future community events, and descriptions of mailing lists used by the community can be found [here on The Carpentries website](http://carpentries.org/community/) and also on the [getting connected page](https://carpentries.org/connect/).

> ## Participating in The Carpentries -- What is Your Role?
>
> If you are at an in-person training, your Trainer will hand out paper copies of a worksheet. If you are at an online training, you can get a [digital copy here]({{ page.root }}/files/handouts/Carpentries_roles_worksheet_v4.pdf).
>
> Take a moment to review member community roles on [The Carpentries community website](http://carpentries.org/community/). Working on your own, match up the roles with the descriptions. When you are done, think about the question at the bottom of the worksheet about what roles you might play, and enter your thoughts in the Etherpad.
