As instructors, it's not only good to use formative assessment 
for the benefit of learners; our formative assessment for our own 
teaching comes in the form of frequent feedback.  We'll talk more 
about feedback [later this afternoon](performance.md), but before 
we leave this morning, here is a list of some of the methods we will use to 
gather feedback from participants during this training.  

## Minute Cards

We frequently use sticky notes as *minute cards*: before each break,
learners take a minute to write one positive thing on the green sticky
note (e.g., one thing they've learned that they think will be useful),
and one thing they found too fast, too slow, confusing, or irrelevant
on the red one.  They can use the red sticky note for questions that
haven't yet been answered.  While they are enjoying their coffee or
lunch, the instructors review and cluster these to find patterns.  It
only takes a few minutes to see what learners are enjoying, what they
still find confusing, what problems they're having, and what questions
are still unanswered.

## One-Up, One-Down

We frequently ask workshop participants to give us feedback at the end
of each day using a technique called "one up, one down".  The
instructor asks the learners to alternately give one positive and one
negative point about the day, without repeating anything that has
already been said.  This requirement forces people to say things they
otherwise might not: once all the "safe" feedback has been given,
participants will start saying what they really think. The instructor
writes down the feedback in the Etherpad or a text editor,
but is not supposed to comment on the feedback while collecting it.

## Surveys

Surveys (electronic or paper) are a convenient way to gather more 
structured feedback from workshop participants.  A survey can range 
from a formal exit survey (which you will fill out at the end of 
tomorrow) or an electronic form of filling in minute cards.  

> ## Fill In Minute Cards
>
> Write one thing you learned this morning that you found useful on
> your green sticky note, and one question you have about the material
> on the red.  Do *not* put your name on the notes: this is meant to
> be anonymous feedback.  Add your notes to the pile by the door as
> you leave to get coffee.
