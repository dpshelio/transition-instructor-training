## Building Teaching Skill
In this training, we have discussed many cognitive principles and teaching practices that guide underlie the design and 
implementation of Carpentries Workshops.
We hope you are feeling excited and optimistic about putting 
those concepts to work! 
One thing we have emphasized is that **teaching is a skill** - and a complex one at that. 
Whether you are new to teaching or skilled in certain methods, adding new features takes takes time, effort, and deliberate practice. In this episode, 
we will walk through some suggestions about how to prepare yourself for success in the classroom.

As in other sections, **we will not discuss technical preparation**. Carefully reviewing the content of your workshop is important! 
However, it is common for new Instructors to
over-prepare on technical content -- which can be endless if you anticipate every possible question! -- and under-prepare the 
learner-centered elements of their teaching practice. If you encounter
technical questions that you do not have answers to, showing learners how you Google things may earn you some surprisingly positive 
feedback! On the other hand, neglecting
to attend to the audience can have a significant and lasting negative impact on a workshop.

When you prepare to teach a workshop, 
we suggest setting aside time *before* deeply reviewing your technical content to **think through the learner experience, how
your teaching will translate into their learning, and how both of you will know when that happens**. In this episode, we will provide
some structure for that preparation.

## Anticipate Your Audience

To teach effectively, you have to know *who* you are teaching. You may have a broad idea about the type of audience you expect. You may
(we hope!) have a plan to learn a few things about your participants after a class has begun. However, in thinking about your learners, it is 
also important to consider the broader contexts they bring in ways that you will never get to fully explore in your classroom. It can be helpful
to reserve time to think through ways in which learners' experiences and needs may be similar to or different from your own, or from each others. 

> ## Imagine a Learner
>
> Take a moment to silently imagine a learner who might attend your workshop. What is their background? What problem do they face? 
> What will they gain from attending your workshop? 
> 
> This exercise should take about 2 minutes.

As you strive to anticipate your audience, it is 
useful to recognize that you will never know everything about the whole people who come into your classroom. You will not
be informed about their hopes and fears beyond what they choose to present. You will never know the full spectrum of neurodiversity represented in your
workshop. You will not know who is going through a rough break-up, who struggles with an abusive work environment, who has a sick baby at home, or who skipped 
breakfast to save money that morning. What challenges might affect your imaginary person? Thinking deeply about learners as people can help you prepare to bring your 
best self and provide an inclusive environment for everyone.

### Remember Your Pre-Workshop Surveys
The Carpentries strives to create useful assessment instruments that can help you plan and understand your workshop. Pre-survey data will likely accumulate 
right up to the start of your workshop. Be sure to check the links sent by The Carpentries Workshop Administration Team for the most up-to-date information 
about your trainees. If you think our surveys could benefit from new or different questions, please let us know!

## Reverse Your Preparation Process

Now that you have a sense of who might be in your classroom, a good next step is to think through **their experience with the content you plan to teach**. 
This is different from thinking through the content itself. 

In curriculum design, most people naturally approach development in the order in which they use it. Lessons first, then assessments. Learning objectives
are often created last, if they are created at all. However, learning objectives play the important role of focusing attention on the **learner experience**.

In course design, therefore, we strive to take a ["reverse" approach][Wiggins]. The order of course design in this case becomes

1.  Determine learning objectives, deciding what constitutes evidence that each has been met
2.  Design assessments to generate that evidence, and sort in order of increasing complexity
3.  Design lesson content to connect assessments

This process is much more likely to lead to an appropriately stepped curriculum that guides learners to specific goals and demonstrates to both instructors
and learners that those goals have been met. 

In the case of Carpentries workshops, the lesson has already been designed, and pre-written exercises are often available to use for assessment. Yet, the 
the design process has many similarities to preparation, including a common tendency to start with technical content review, 
work through the exercises, and maybe 
(or maybe not) think through the learning objectives. Here, **reverse 
instructional design** principles might be applied as follows: 

1. Review the lesson's learning objectives carefully, thinking about how they will work for your audience
2. Scan the lesson to identify promising points to check in with your learners, using formative assessment to verify that objectives have been met, and then 
3. Review the connecting content in detail to be sure everything works and you have anticipated likely problems and questions.

## Examine Learning Objectives
All Carpentries lessons should have learning objectives listed at the top of each episode. Did you notice these
in your lesson? In the best 
cases they are quite specific about what a learner should be able to do by the end of each episode.
This can be helpful in both designing additional formative assessments and in evaluating potential additions or digressions for 
appropriateness.

When thinking about learning objectives, it is important to keep the 'level' of a learner in mind. There are many ways of conceptualizing 'level' in education. 
However, you probably have your own sense of what kinds of goals can be achieved by a novice, and what kinds of things can
only be achieved after some 'groundwork' has been laid. 

> ## Evaluate Learning Objectives
>
> Select one learning objective from the episode you've used for teaching practice. Copy it into the etherpad
> then add numbers below your objective to address the following:
>
> 1. Write your learning objective in the Etherpad. 
> 2. Suppose a learner had mastered this objective, and wanted to do more to advance their mastery of the same topic. Identify an objective they could work towards next.
> 3. Suppose a learner struggled to meet the specified objective. What might they be missing? Identify one more fundamental thing a learner needs to be able to do in order to be successful in meeting this objective.
>
> This exercise should take about 10 minutes.

## Prepare to Use Formative Assessments
In your answers above, you may have found yourself using words like "know" and "understand." These are words we are accustomed to using when we talk about 
teaching and learning! However, these terms are so broad that they are actually quite difficult to use when it comes time to *assess* whether a learner has met 
that objective. When do you *know* something? What does it mean to *understand*? 

When we want to check on the completion of a learning objective, we create tasks, and these tasks usually test knowledge and understanding in very specific ways.
For example, we might ask a learner to *recognize* a correct answer, or to *distinguish* between correct and incorrect answers. After working through an example, 
we might ask them to *apply* their knowledge to a new task. When words like these are used in learning objectives, it makes it easier to decide how to assess 
whether an objective has truly been met. 

When a learning objective has been met, everyone should know about it! You, as an Instructor, can be satisfied that your teaching has successfully translated
into learning. For learners, recognizing that they have successfully learned something is motivating and it also supports their ability to monitor their own 
progress -- this awareness, or **metacognition**, is especially key to supporting continued learning beyond the classroom. However, not all lessons have 
checkpoints built in where such progress is made clear.

> ## Where are your checkpoints?
>
> Have a look at your learning objective again and identify
> *where* in the lesson that objective should reasonably be achieved.

When subject area experts design instruction, they are often over-eager to get their learners to work with content they have learned in advanced ways. These 
might include tasks that ask learners to synthesize information from different sources, or create something new based on what they have learned. It is essential 
to recognize that these 'higher order' tasks rely on many layers of fundamental understanding, and are therefore prone to failure when applied to novices. 
Awareness of exactly what underlying knowledge is required at each step will help you to avoid asking too much. For more guidance on identifying the "level" of 
a particular task, we recommend having a look at one of many excellent references on Bloom's Taxonomy.

### How Frequent?
Instructors should use a formative assessment ideally every 5 minutes and
at least every 10-15 minutes
in order to make sure that the class is actually learning.
Since the average attention span is usually only this long,
formative assessments also help break up instructional time
and re-focus attention.
Formative assessments can also be used preemptively:
if you start a class with a question and everyone can answer it correctly,
then you can safely skip the part of the lecture
in which you were going to explain something that your learners already know.


> ## "Do You Understand?" is Ineffective as a Formative Assessment
>
> Learners are often reluctant to admit when they do not understand. Furthermore, self-assessments of skill in the absence of formative assessment are often inaccurate
> because of the [Dunning-Kruger effect][Dunning]:
> the less people know about a subject,
> the less accurate their estimate of their knowledge is. Therefore, if you ask a room full of people
> "Do you understand?" the result will invariably be a number of 'yes' responses (many of them inaccurate) which tend to drown out a
> variable amount of silence. Instead, a targeted formative assessment takes the inaccuracy and stress of self-judgement away and 
> demonstrates to all whether the learners' level of understanding has
> met the instructor's goal.

## Prepare to Cut
Collaborative maintenance of curriculum materials allows The Carpentries to maintain up-to-date workshops in a rapidly changing world. 
We hope you will join in to support our Maintainers in overseeing this process, and even consider becoming a curriculum Maintainer yourself! 
However, there is one down-side to collaborative upkeep: adding content is a much more fun way to contribute than proposing content to remove. 
Every workshop moves at its own pace, but if you are following our recommendations to **go slowly** and pause for formative assessment, it is likely
that you will have to make cuts in what you plan to teach. Indeed, despite our best efforts at maintaining this curriculum, your Instructor Trainers 
may well have had to make cuts to make space for great conversations or extra questions in this training! 

There are many ways to make cuts in a workshop, and they can have variable knock-on effects to watch out for. A little advance planning goes a long way 
to avoid making mistakes when you start cutting things 'on the fly.'
- **Keep breaks on time** even if your content is split awkwardly around them. Delaying breaks can demotivate your audience and disrupt plans they may 
make around announced break times.
- **Watch out for dependencies** if you skip a step. It may not be a step they *needed to know* about, but it may generate or re-name a file that is used 
in later episodes.
- **Leave time to wrap up your workshop** even if this means cutting even more content. We will talk about this more shortly.
- **Do not speed up** if you are running behind! All curricula are freely available so learners can visit content they have missed; this means there is very 
little to be gained by "quickly covering" (but not actually teaching) content.
- **Communicate with your team** about what you plan to cut, or what you decided to leave out. Do not assume anyone will notice if you skip something. They may be 
able to find a way to fit certain concepts in with later content if they know it has been missed.
- **Communicate with your learners** about where they can find skipped content and whether any help may be available to support their independent work. Cutting 
content may make them feel anxious, but it will help for them to know how to follow up.


## Review Prior Feedback
When is the best time to review your post-workshop survey responses and other feedback that you received during a workshop? We certainly recommend 
taking time to do this after a workshop, while your memories are still fresh. However, we *also* recommend having a look again **before you teach your 
next workshop**. This will help refresh your memory of all that went well (yay!) as well as challenges you faced and learners who struggled at certain points. 
What will you keep the same, and what will you do differently? 
Just a few moments of reflective practice with prior feedback will go a long way towards building your skill as a teacher and making each workshop you teach 
better than the last.


> ## Repetition vs. Reflective Practice
>
> The idea that ten thousand hours of practice will make someone an expert in some field

> but reality is much more complex.
> Practice is not doing the same thing over and over again:
> practice is doing similar but subtly different things,

> and then changing behavior in response to that feedback to get cumulatively better.
> Doing the same thing over and over again is much more likely to solidify bad habits than perfect performance.
> This is why we emphasize practice and feedback for learners at our workshops and for trainees in our
> Instructor Training program.

## Connect With Your Team
Are you teaching with some of the same team-members you taught with previously? If so, this is a great time for *collaborative* feedback review! Depending on 
your team's preferences, many of the independent preparation steps described here can be carried out collaboratively or at least in good company. In addition, 
we will talk about how to prepare with your team to create a cohesive classroom experience in a later episode.
