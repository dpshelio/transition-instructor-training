### Mindset

Do you believe that you're just not good at math? Or maybe you're not artistic? Not good at sports? If any of these
sound like you, you probably have a fixed mindset when it comes to mathematical, artistic and/or athletic ability. 

Carol Dweck, now a professor of Psychology at Stanford University, has conducted decades of research focused on understanding
people's attitudes towards ability, our beliefs about whether ability is ingrained or developed, and how those beliefs
affect our perseverence in learning. She's discovered that, in any given area, people tend to have either a fixed mindset - believing that 
someone's ability in that area is intrinsic, you're either born with it or you're not - or a growth mindset - believing that, with enough effort, 
almost anyone can learn almost anything. 

People with a fixed mindset tend to avoid effort and to give up when faced with failure or challenge. They also 
tend to take fewer risks, be less likely to take an opportunity to learn something new and to feel best about themselves when they perform flawlessly. 
In contrast, people with a growth mindset tend to actively seek challenges and to work harder when faced with failure. They regularly take risks and 
take advantage of opportunities for learning new skills. In fact, initial difficulties in a topic make them more interested and motivated to learn!

People who believe that ability is intrinsic view every situation as a test. A failure indicates that they don't have the natural ability they need
to succeed. Thus, students with a fixed-mindset will *decrease* their study time after receiving a poor exam score, because they see this score as a
judgement that they aren't good at that subject and shouldn't waste their time trying. A growth-mindset student will increase the amount of time that 
they study after the same score, seeing it as an indication that they need to try harder to improve in that area.  

This attitude towards failure leads fixed-mindset people to avoid situations where they will be required to perform. They will not volunteer to answer
questions in class or to demonstrate a sports technique to their team. This tendency prevents fixed-mindset people from getting opportunities to practice
and receive feedback, which as we've discussed (FIXME add link to practice module) is essential to learning.

> ## Test your Mindset
> You can learn about your own mindset by taking the official [mindset self-assessment](https://mindsetonline.com/testyourmindset/step1.php). 
> Keep in mind that your mindset may differ in different areas. For example, you might have a fixed mindset with respect to artistic ability,
> but a growth mindset with respect to computing skill.

If you recognize aspects of the fixed mindset in yourself, don't panic! Like everything else, a growth mindset can be learned. We're going to talk about some
strategies that will help you promoting a growth mindset in your learners and yourself.

### Praise talk  

The way in which we praise learners has an important impact on their mindset development. Carol Dweck's research (FIXME: add ref)
investigated three types of praise: performance-based, effort-based and improvement-based, and looked at how these 
types of praise influence learner's mindsets.

We're most used to hearing performance-based praise. This sort of praise focuses on outcomes and implies that the 
outcome (for example, getting a correct answer) is the most important part of the task. It is often (but not always)
combined with language that explicitly or implicitly supports the "intrinsic" model of competence. For example, "You 
did a great job! You must be very smart."

Effort-based praise focuses on the learner's hard work. For example, "You did a good job, you must have worked very hard." 
Exposing learners frequently to this type of praise helps them to transition from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset by 
changing their perception of effort. For fixed-mindset people, if something doesn't come easy to you, it means that you 
don't have natural ability and shouldn't bother. People with a growth mindset are much more likely to persevere in the face of challenge
and accomplish their goals.

Improvement-based praise is related to praise based on effort, but explicitly draws a learner's attention to the progress they've made.
For example, "You're doing so much better at this than last time, you must have worked very hard." This helps reinforce a growth-mindset by 
highlighting our ability to improve with effort.
