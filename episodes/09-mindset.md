### Mindset

Learners can be demotivated in subtler ways as well.
For example,
Dweck and others have studied the differences of
[fixed mindset and growth mindset][wikipedia-growth-mindset].
If people believe that competence in some area is intrinsic
(i.e., that you either "have the gene" for it or you don't),
*everyone* does worse, including the supposedly advantaged.
The reason is that if they don't get it at first,
they figure they just don't have that aptitude,
which biases future performance.
On the other hand,
if people believe that a skill is learned and can be improved,
they do better on average.

A person's mindset can be shaped by subtle cues.
For example,
if a child is told,
"You did a good job, you must be very smart,"
she is likely to develop a fixed mindset.
If on the other hand she is told,
"You did a good job, you must have worked very hard,"
she is likely to develop a growth mindset,
and subsequently achieve more.  Studies have also shown that
the simple action of telling learners about the different mindsets
before a course can improve learning outcomes for the whole group.
