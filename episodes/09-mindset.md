### Mindset

**Add intro to mindset here.**

If people believe that competence in some area is intrinsic
(i.e., that you either "have the gene" for it or you don't),
*everyone* does worse, including the supposedly advantaged.
The reason is that if they don't get it at first,
they figure they just don't have that aptitude,
which biases future performance.
On the other hand,
if people believe that a skill is learned and can be improved,
they do better on average.


### Praise talk  

The way in which we praise learners has an important impact on their mindset development. Carol Dweck's research (FIXME: add ref)
investigated three types of praise: performance-based, effort-based and improvement-based, and looked at how these 
types of praise influence learner's mindsets.

We're most used to hearing performance-based praise. This sort of praise focuses on outcomes and implies that the 
outcome (for example, getting a correct answer) is the most important part of the task. It is often (but not always)
combined with language that explicitly or implicitly supports the "intrinsic" model of competence. For example, "You 
did a great job! You must be very smart."

Effort-based praise focuses on the learner's hard work. For example, "You did a good job, you must have worked very hard." 
Exposing learners frequently to this type of praise helps them to transition from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset by 
changing their perception of effort. For fixed-mindset people, if something doesn't come easy to you, it means that you 
don't have natural ability and shouldn't bother. People with a growth mindset are much more likely to persevere in the face of challenge
and accomplish their goals.

Improvement-based praise is related to praise based on effort, but explicitly draws a learner's attention to the progress they've made.
For example, "You're doing so much better at this than last time, you must have worked very hard." This helps reinforce a growth-mindset by 
highlighting our ability to improve with effort.
