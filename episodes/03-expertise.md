# Examining Your Expertise
Having previously discussed the transition from novice to competent practitioner,
via the formation of a mental model, we now shift our attention to experts. It is
unlikely that you will be teaching experts; the expert we want to talk about is you!
You might not yet think of yourself as an expert, but chances are you have already
advanced to the point where some of these key characteristics -- and potential pitfalls -- apply to you.
We will discuss what distinguishes expertise
from novices/competent practitioners, how being an expert can make it
more difficult to teach novices, and some tools to help instructors
identify and overcome these difficulties.  

## What Makes an Expert?  

An [earlier topic]({{ page.root }}/02-practice-learning/) described a key
difference between novices and competent practitioners. Novices lack a mental model, or have only
a very incomplete model with limited utility.
Competent practitioners
have mental models that work well enough for most situations.
How are experts different from both of these groups?

Off-hand, some might simplify the notion of an "expert" as someone who simply knows more facts,
but in reviewing the answers to the question above you will find that the expert 
experience amounts to much more than that. Indeed, experts are often unaware of many of 
the "facts" that they actually know. But you cannot construct expertise on facts alone.
Competent practitioners can memorize a lot of information
without any noticeable improvement to their performance. So, what makes an expert? The answer is
rather that experts have **more connections among pieces of knowledge**;
more "short-cuts", if you will.  

![Three collections of six circles. The first collection is labelled "Novice" and has only two arrows connecting some of the circles. The second collection, labelled "Competent Practitioner" has six connecting arrows. The third collection, labelled "Expert", is densly connected, with eight connecting arrows.](../fig/mental_models.svg)

This brings us back to our mental model diagrams,
where facts are nodes and relationships are arcs.
The key difference between experts and competent practitioners
is that experts have many more connections among concepts.
This allows experts to:

* see connections between two topics or ideas that no one else can see
* see a single problem in several different ways
* know how to solve a problem, or "what questions to ask"
* jump directly from a problem to its solution
because there is a direct link between the two in their mind.
Where a competent practitioner would have to reason
"A therefore B therefore C therefore D therefore E",
the expert can go from A to E in a single step ("A therefore E").

We will expand on some of these below and how they can manifest in the way you teach.

## Expertise and Teaching

Because your learners' mental models will likely be less densely connected than your own,
a conclusion that seems obvious to you will not seem that way to your learners.  It is important
to explain what you are doing step-by-step, and how each step leads to the next one.

### Mind The Gap

The problem with this is that when you are used to going from A to E in a single leap, it can 
be very hard to remember that novices need to walk through B, C, and D to understand the 
connection. Experts are frequently so familiar with their subject 
that they can no longer imagine what it is like to *not* understand the world that way. 
This phenomenon is known in the literature as an *expert blind spot*.

> ## Expert Awareness Gap

> (it is not about seeing, but about noticing) and feels more of a surmountable
> challenge than a disadvantage. To me a disadvantage can sometimes feel like

> thing to be bridged-- and we certainly want instructors to try to overcome
> (or mitigate) their expert awareness gap

This can lead to some interesting reversals in the classroom. While deep expertise in a subject 
area *can* be valuable when teaching, it can also create obstacles that must be overcome with practice. 
People with less expertise, who still remember what it is like to have to learn the things, can 
be better equipped to anticipate novice misconceptions compared with an expert who has not learned 
to identify their awarenesss gaps. 

What does this mean for you? If you have deep expertise in the subject you are hoping to teach, listen 
carefully to your learners, and seek out less-expert colleagues to discuss your teaching plans. 
If, on the other hand, you still feel new to your subject area -- perhaps you even feel a little 
tentative about whether you are "expert enough" to teach -- take heart! Your explanations may 
be more likely to meet novice learners where they are.

### Bait and Switch
Just as experts may have many to connect concepts at their disposal, they may 
also have many ways of *describing or demonstrating concepts*. 
If you worked in the same building as something called a "delicatessen", 
you might invite a friend to meet you at "the deli" or simply at
"the restaurant" and expect them to know what you mean. 
Yet, a novice in English might hesitate, wondering if 
these words mean the same thing, or close enough, under the circumstances. Similarly, 
in a Carpentries workshop, an Instructor may alternate using "Unix", "bash", and "shell" 
without noticing that learners are struggling to figure out how these 
three new words are related.

Novice learners can be confused by interchangeable use of more than just vocabulary. 
In programming, multiple forms of notation may be 
used to reference a column in a data frame, for example, with the same effect. 
Instructors may use absolute file paths in one place, then default to relative file paths 
elsewhere without noticing that explanation is required.

> In the Etherpad, share an example of words or notation that you sometimes use to accomplish or refer to the same thing.

### What Problem?

Experts are also better at diagnosing errors than novices or competent practitioners. If faced with an
error message while teaching, an expert will often figure out the cause of the error and develop a solution
before a novice has even finished reading the error message. Because of this, it is very important
while teaching to be explicit about the process you are using to diagnose and correct errors, even if they
seem trivial to you, as they often will.

> ## Diagnosis  (Optional)
>
> What is an error message that you encounter frequently in your work? (These are often syntax errors.)
> Take a few minutes to plan out how you would explain that error message to your learners. Write the
> error and your explanation in the Etherpad.
>
> This discussion should take about 5 minutes.

## Dismissive Language  
Instructors want to motivate learners. We will talk about great ways to do to this! But here, 
we will take a moment to recognize one *ineffective* strategy often deployed by experts who 
want learners to *believe that a task is as easy as they think it is.* This often manifests 
in using the word "just" in explanations,
as in, "Look, it is easy, you just fire up a new virtual machine
and then you just install these four patches to Ubuntu
and then you just re-write your entire program in a pure functional style---no problem."
This gives learners the very clear signal
that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial
and that they therefore must be incapable if they do not experience it that way. 

With practice, we can change the way we speak to avoid this type of demotivating language and replace
it with more positive and motivating word choices.

> ## Changing Your Language  
>
> What other words or phrases can have the effect of demotivating learners? What alternatives can we use to
> express this meaning in a positive and motivational way?  
> Write your **examples and alternatives** in the Etherpad.
>
> This discussion should take about 5 minutes.  
>
>> ## Solution  
>> It is hard to break the habit of trying to convince learners that a task is "easy"! A few alternatives 
>> might include statements like:
>> - "This task will become really easy once you have learned how to do it."
>> - "We only need to learn two new commands to accomplish the next task."
>> - "This task may feel like it will take you all year to learn, but in my experience it will take you a lot less time than that to master it."

### Any Questions?

Another way in which well-intended experts can accidentally dismiss learner concerns is by asking for questions in 
a way that subtly indicates that they do not expect (or wish) that anyone will actually have them. Asking, "Does anyone have 
any questions?" implies that most people will not; this implication can be magnified by a short wait time after 
asking. Instead, consider asking "What questions do you have?" and leaving a healthy pause for consideration. 
This firmly establishes an expectation that
people will, indeed, have questions, and should challenge themselves to formulate them.

## You Are Not Your Learners  

As you seek to re-acquaint yourself with the novice experience, it can be tempting to try to think back to your own 
experiences getting started in programming. Trips down memory lane can be productive! However, it is important that 
you take care not to generalize from your experience to that of your novice learners. 

We will talk more about knowing your audience in a later episode. For now, here are 
two points to keep in mind when contemplating the learner experience 
- In most cases a researcher's **primary goal is not to learn programming**, but to do better and more efficient research.
They may not wish to take the time to learn how hash tables work,
or even want to know that hash tables exist; they just want to know how to get their work done. This means their interests may 
be very different from what yours were, even if they are learning some of the same things you did when you began.
- Some researchers have avoided learning programming previously because they believe that the time investment 
will be excessive and will interfere with their other work. These kinds of beliefs can make their motivation to 
persevere more fragile than yours might have been when you got started.

> Many of the foundational concepts of computer science,
> such as computability,

> This does *not* mean that they are not important,

> they are less compelling than things like automating repetitive tasks.

## Expert Advantages

In these ways and others, the high connectivity of an expert's mental model poses challenges while teaching
novices. However, that is not to say that experts cannot be great teachers!  Because of their well-connected 
knowledge, self-aware experts are well-poised
to help students make meaningful connections, to confidently
turn an error into a learning opportunity, or to explain
a complex topic in multiple ways. Experts can
be highly effective as long as they **learn to identify and correct
for their own expert awareness gaps**. Whether or not you identify as an expert, we hope this episode has started you on the 
path toward developing that skill.

## The Importance of Practice (Again)

Have we mentioned that formative assessments are a good idea, and that you should use them frequently? Asking targeted 
questions to check for understanding will give you valuable information about your learners' goals, 
motivations, and progress. If you stumble into an expert awareness gap, create confusion by using interchangeable terms, or 
accidentally quell rather than inviting questions, frequent formative assessment has the power to bring these problems to the surface. 
As you develop teaching skill, you may be able to avoid these pitfalls. Until then, becoming aware of when they occur should be 
a primary goal.
