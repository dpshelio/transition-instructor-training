# Never Teach Alone
One of the greatest strengths of Carpentries workshops compared with many other instructional settings is that workshops are prepared and executed
by more than one person. We ask that at least two Instructors teach in every workshop, and some workshops may have many more! During the workshop,
you should also have a crew of Helpers to answer questions individually, elevate common problems for general discussion, and make sure the pacing 
works for everyone.

The people who are planning and executing your workshop with you can really lighten the load! They are also there to
help if you find yourself in a sticky situation. However, from logistics planning to delicate problem solving, a little planning goes a long
way, and all co-Instructors should be in agreement about how they will support each other in engaging challenges. 
In this episode, we will discuss examples, strategies, and resources for handling challenges you may face in the classroom. We will
also take some time to discuss planning logistics, and (time permitting) everyone will have an opportunity to try out
our instructions for setting up a workshop website.

## Sticky Situations 1: Teaching to Diverse Skill Levels

Although our workshops are targeted at novices, every workshop
will have participants from a variety of backgrounds and technical
skill levels. Some may be at the novice level in one technology (e.g. git),
but competent or even expert in another (e.g. R). As an instructor,
you will need to be attentive to this diversity in your learners' prior skill level,
and adjust your instruction appropriately. This can seem like an impossible challenge!
But with a solid team approach you will be surprised how many people can come
away feeling satisfied that their time was well spent.

> What are some of the challenges you might expect when teaching learners with a broad range of expertise? Add your thoughts in the Etherpad.

> This discussion should take about 5 minutes.
{: .challenge}

Here are some strategies Carpentries
instructors have generated to deal with this issue:

*   When planning a workshop, be sure that all advertisements
    communicate its level clearly
    by describing not only the topics (e.g. plotting in R), but
    also the specific skills and tasks (i.e. the learning objectives).
    If advanced learners do sign up anyway (and they may!), this will be an informed choice.
*   When preparing your exercises, consider creating "beginner" and "advanced" options.
    Learners who finish the "beginner" exercise can then challenge themselves with a next step.
*   During class, encourage learners to help people next to them when they feel comfortable doing so.
    Teaching is a great way to level up learning (one of many reasons why Carpentries Instructors choose to teach!).
    Note that you may need an icebreaker before your learners will take this advice.
*   Do not let advanced learners carry the conversation in class, no matter how interesting it may be. This can alienate novices
    and consumes valuable class time. Advanced questions and comments can be politely reserved for breaks, addressed
    individually by helpers or the co-Instructor, or typed in the Etherpad for present or future follow-up.
*   The helpers and the Instructor who is not teaching the particular episode
    should be vigilant for learners who are falling behind
    and intervene early
    so that they do not become frustrated and give up. Frequent reminders
    to put up sticky notes for "ok" or "I'm stuck" will support your 
    team in targeting problems in time.

No class can possibly meet all individual training needs.
However, it is entirely possible for total beginners and advanced learners
to come away happy from the same workshop. Beginners may not yet feel competent,
but they may build a mental model of the domain and develop confidence that they *can*
learn these skills because they have successfully been walked through them. Advanced
learners may enjoy picking up "tips and tricks" or having their own self-taught approach
validated. They may also enjoy connecting with your workshop community, and might 
consider becoming Carpentries Instructors themselves! 

Dealing effectively with different skill levels does take some planning. However, with
appropriate advertising and team cohesion on priorities and strategies, your workshop
can be a worthwhile experience for everyone.


## Sticky Situations 2: Code of Conduct Violations

As discussed in the [Motivation episode]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/08-motivation.md %}),
the Carpentries uses a Code of Conduct as a tool to create a respectful and
inclusive learning environment. This works well! But Codes of Conduct do not hold up if they
are not enforced. Rarely, your instructional team
may encounter a Code of Conduct violation. In this section, we will discuss resources available to
help you prepare and respond appropriately in the event that a violation occurs.

All Carpentries community members should feel empowered to enforce the Code of Conduct (CoC). However, you may not
feel comfortable taking action alone, and you may wish to be informed when a team-member takes action in your workshop. 
For these reasons and more we encourage you to **discuss Code of Conduct enforcement with your instructional team in advance**. 

> ## Know Your Resources
> 1) Take 5 minutes to read through the Code of Conduct Incident Response Guidelines: https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-response.html
> 2) Discuss what you have read in small groups. What would you want to discuss or have your instructional team agree upon in advance of your workshop? 
> What questions do you have about CoC enforcement? Write some notes in the etherpad. 
>
> This discussion should take about 15 minutes.
{: .challenge}

Fortunately, Code of Conduct violations have been extremely rare in our community. Emphasizing our values up front really
does make a difference. However, we recognize that the time set aside to discuss this topic is not adequate to thoroughly prepare
everyone to face such a situation. Because this challenge is not unique to Instructors, The Carpentries is currently working
to address this unmet training need more broadly across our community through development of a Code of Conduct Facilitator role. Follow
our communications channels to learn about additional opportunities for training in this area.

## In The Classroom: Nuts and Bolts of a Carpentries Workshop

The best thing about managing a classroom for a Carpentries workshop is that you never face problems alone! Your co-instructor, helpers, and host are all there for you.
*Co-teaching* describes any situation in which two teachers work
together in the same classroom.  Friend and Cook's
*[Interactions][worldcat-interactions]* describes several ways to do
this; we use the following methods most frequently:

- **Team teaching:** Both teachers deliver a single stream of content
  in tandem, taking turns the way that musicians taking solos would.

- **Teach and assist:** Teacher A teaches while Teacher B moves around
  the classroom to help learners.

Both of these models are better than teaching alone because they create
opportunities for lateral knowledge transfer.
Team teaching is particularly beneficial in day-long
workshops: not only does it give each teacher's voice a chance to
rest, it reduces the risk that they will be so tired by the end of the
day that they will start snapping at their learners or fumbling at
their keyboard.  Having a co-instructor also means that you can teach
a workshop without knowing all the topics that are being taught, and
if multiple instructors are both knowledgeable on the same topics,
they can help each other answer questions.

Putting some thought into how you and your co-instructor will work together can make the most out of this supporting relationship and can make the difference between a good workshop and a great one -- for you and for your learners.

> ## How to Help
>
> Many people are willing and
> able to provide in-class support.  We call these people "helpers."
>
> Helpers can assist in a variety
> of ways: help learners
> with setup and installation, answer questions during
> exercises, monitor the room to spot people who may need help, or
> keep an eye on the shared notes and either answer questions there or
> remind the instructor to do so during breaks.
> The [helper checklist][helpers] describes what helpers can do to
> help instructors in more detail.
>
> Helpers are sometimes people training to become teachers (i.e.,
> they are Teacher B in the teach and assist model), but they can also
> be advanced learners who already know the material well, previous
> workshop participants, or members of the host institution's technical
> support staff.
> Using advanced learners as helpers is doubly effective: not only are they
> more likely to understand the problems their peers are having, it
> also stops them from getting bored.

> ## Teaching Together - Nuts and Bolts
>
> With a partner, imagine that you are planning a workshop together
> and answer the following questions:
>
> - How would you prepare to teach a workshop together?
> - During the workshop, what are some things the assisting instructor
> can do (or should not do!) to support the main instructor?
>
> As an entire group, discuss what you came up with and then compare
> to the recommendations below.
>
>> ## Recommendations
>>
>> If you and a partner are co-teaching, try to follow these recommendations:
>>
>>- Coordinate who is teaching what, sufficiently in advance that
>>  both instructors are confident in their preparation.
>>
>>- If you have time to do some
>>  advance preparation together, try drawing a concept map together or
>>  teaching a short snippet of the lessons for each other.
>>
>>- Discuss in advance if you will providing feedback to each other
>>  and how to do so (see notes above).
>>
>>- If it will not cause cognitive overload for you (the instructors),
>>  work out a couple of hand signals to communicate.  "You are
>>  going too fast", "speak up", "that learner needs help", and, "It is
>>  time for a bathroom break" are all useful.
>>
>>- The person who is not teaching should not interrupt, offer
>>  corrections, elaborations, or amusing personal anecdotes, or do
>>  anything else to distract from what the person teaching at the time
>>  is doing or saying.  The one exception is that it is sometimes
>>  helpful to ask leading questions, particularly if the learners seem
>>  unsure of themselves.
>>
>>- For Carpentries workshops, a single instructor usually teaches for a
>>  half-day stretch (2-3 hours).  You can alternate more frequently, but
>>  each person should teach for at least 10-15 minutes at a stretch,
>>  since learners may be distracted by more frequent interleaving.
>>
>>- Each person should take a couple of minutes before they start
>>  teaching to see what their partner is going to teach after they are
>>  done.  This allows each instructor to set up their partner's material
>>  without covering it themselves.
>>
>>- Whenever possible, the person who is not teaching should stay engaged
>>  with the class.  Monitor the shared notes, keep an eye
>>  on the learners to see who is struggling, jot down some feedback to
>>  give your teaching partner at the next break - anything that
>>  contributes to the lesson is better than anything that does not.  It is
>>  easier for the other instructor to take a break to catch up on outside
>>  work (like email) if there are at least
>>  three instructors or sufficient helpers to make sure that the main
>>  instructor is supported.

In teaching as in life, shared misery is lessened and shared joy increased;
take a few minutes when the class is over to either
congratulate or commiserate with each other.  In that moment,
no-one will better understand how pleased you are at helping someone
understand how loops work, or how disappointed you are that you just
could not get software to install on that one learner's laptop, than
the person you just taught with.

## In Advance: Preparing Together

### Setting up a Workshop Website

In order to communicate with learners,
and to help us keep track of who has taught what and where,
instructors create a website with information about their workshop.

To ensure unique names for each event,
we use the `year-month-day-venue` format for the identifier, the slug.
For instance, for a workshop that starts on Febuary 22nd, 2022
at the University of Data Skills,
the slug would be `2022-02-22-data-skills`. If your workshop will be held online, you will add that to the slug as well, making it `2022-02-22-data-skills-online`.
If you are teaching a centrally-organized workshop,
please wait for the email from your regional coordinator
that will tell you the slug to use for your workshop.

Once your workshop website has been created,
the host or lead instructor sends its URL to
the [workshop coordinator](mailto:team@carpentries.org),
who adds it to our records.
The workshop will show up on our websites shortly thereafter.

You may also create an Etherpad for your workshop
(or other Carpentries-related event).
When you point a browser to a url at
`https://pad.carpentries.org/workshop-slug`
(e.g., `https://pad.carpentries.org/2022-02-22-data-skills`
for the example above)
you will either arrive at an existing Etherpad by that name or a brand new
etherpad with basic Carpentries information at the top.

> ## Practice With The Carpentries Infrastructure
> 
> For this activity, your Trainer will put you in groups, but you may choose whether to work together or independently. 
> If you work independently, you can still use your group as a resource to ask questions as they emerge. 
>
> Go to the [workshop template repository]({{ site.workshop_repo }}). 
> 
> * If you have a GitHub account (or don't mind quickly creating one) and are comfortable doing so, 
> follow the directions to create a workshop website using your local location and today's date.
> 
> * Alternatively, have a look at the video tutorial linked on the instructions page. With any time
> remaining, have a look at the websites for [upcoming Carpentries workshops][https://carpentries.org/upcoming_workshops/] on our website.
> 
> * Add your questions and thoughts on this process to the Etherpad. If you created a workshop website,
> add the link there as well.
>
> This exercise should take about 25 minutes. 
>
> Note: Sometimes web browsers will cache the workshop webpage, so when
> you make changes in GitHub, they do not show up on the workshop webpage
> immediately.  Two ways to avoid this are to use a "private" or
> "incognito" mode in your web browser or by following these
> [instructions to bypass your browser cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bypass_your_cache).
