Hello everyone, and welcome to the Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry 
instructor training.  We're very pleased to have you with us.

Most of you are probably here because you have attended or helped at 
a Software or Data Carpetnry workshops.  For context
As a brief introduction to Software and Data Carpentry, so that everyone 
has some context about why we're here.  Software and Data Carpentry are 
both communities of volunteer researchers, educators, and more who develop 
lessons and teach 2 day workshops on basic computing and data skills for 
researchers.  Software Carpentry focuses on how researchers can be effective 
computationally and developing software; Data Carpentry focuses on how 
researchers can effectively manage their data.  
Both organizations aren't out to teach specific skills, per se - those 
are covered, but instead, the main goal is best practices that will enable 
researchers to be more productive and do better research.  

In the same way, this training will cover specific teaching skills, but 
one of our main emphases will be the "best practices" of teaching.  A lot 
of what we cover is based on current research and recommendations.  Similarly, 
we will be introducing you to a lot of the practices and philosophies that 
make Software and Data Carpentry unique.  We will *not* be going 
over the workshop content in detail (although we will talke about 
the lessons tomorrow), but instead
focus on developing teaching skills that are broadly
useful across all of our lessons.  Part of this is because 
this two day training is the first step in getting fully certified 
to teach Software and/or Data Carpentry workshops.  
The follow-up steps for full certification will require that you dig into the workshop 
content yourself and we'll talk about that more tomorrow afternoon.  

To orient yourself, there is a schedule on the workshop webpage.  

One aspect of this course's design is its relationship to teaching 
as a performance art.  Just as musicians learn theory, practice techniques, 
and perform for each other, we're going to be looking at some learning 
theory (also known as educational psychology) and why it matters to us 
as Software and Data Carpentry instructors, create exercises and learning 
materials, and practice our teaching.  You can expect a lot of 
hands-on work and discussion.  We'll be using the the etherpad to collect 
answers and help facilitate discussion - if you ever have any questions, 
feel free to put them into the notes or chatbox of the etherpad and we'll 
make sure we get to them by the end of the day.  

One part of making this a productive two days for all of us, is a 
community effort to treat one another with kindness and respect.  This 
training, as in all Software/Data Carpentry workshops is subject to 
the SWC/DC Code of Conduct.  We will be able to have our most productive 
effort (and the most fun!) if everyone abides by these guidelines.  

The greatest asset of Software and 
Data Carpentry is people like yourself - instructors who want to help 
people learn about these things and the experience/enthusiasm they bring 
to teaching.  We hope that this training gives everyone a chance to 
meet new people and share ideas.  

## Assessing Trainee Motivation and Prior Knowledge

It’s important to first assess the prior knowledge of the workshop
participants because this will influence (to some extent) how you
motivate the activities and how you communicate with the attendees.

> ## Background
> 
> *Which of these most accurately describes your teaching experience?*
>
> 1.  I have been a graduate or undergraduate teaching assistant for a university/college course.  
> 2.  I have not had any teaching experience in the past.  
> 3.  I have taught a seminar, workshop, or other short or informal course.  
> 4.  I have been the instructor-of-record for my own university/college course.  
> 5.  I have taught at the K-12 level.  
> 
> *Which of these questions assesses flaws in a student's mental model of a domain?*
> 
> 1. I'm not sure what a mental model is.
> 2. "In Python, what is the expected output for the following statement: 1 + '2'"
> 	(a) '12' 
> 	(b) TypeError 
> 	(c) ‘3’ 
> 	(d) 3
> 3. "Rate your experience with the R programming language." 
> 	(a) never used it 
> 	(b) beginner 
> 	(c) intermediate 
> 	(d) expert
> 4. "What does the unix command 'cut' do?"
> 	(a) Extracts sections from each line of input. 
> 	(b) Sorts fields of a line 
> 	(c) Searches the input file for lines containing a match to a pattern
> 	(d) Removes a given input from a line

Now that we have a better idea of everyone's prior knowledge and
familiarity with some of the SWC and DC teaching practices, we're
ready to begin our training. Our goal is that by the end, you will
have acquired some knew knowledge, confidence, and skills that you can
use in your teaching practice in general and in teaching SWC and DC
workshops specifically.

Let's dive into the theory and practice behind designing multiple
choice questions.
