subtitle: Code of Conduct
---
[Software Carpentry][swc] and [Data Carpentry][dc] workshops are
community events intended for networking and collaboration as well as
learning.  We value the participation of every member of the
scientific community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and
fulfilling experience.  Accordingly, all attendees are expected to
show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the workshop.

To make clear what is expected, everyone taking part in Software and
Data Carpentry events and discussions---instructors, helpers,
organizers, and learners---is required to conform to the following
Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout events,
but you may also contact us directly by email at
[{{site.contact}}](mailto:{{site.contact}}).  All communication will
be treated as confidential.

**Code of Conduct**

Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are dedicated to providing a
harassment-free learning experience for everyone, regardless of
gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
size, race, nationality, religion, or choice of text editor. We do not
tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

1. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
   sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
   race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
   intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
   recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
   inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

2. All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
   including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
   imagery is not appropriate for any event.

3.  Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees.

4.  Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist,
    racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
comply immediately.  Attendees violating these rules may be asked to
leave the event at the sole discretion of the conference organizers
without a refund of any charge that may have been levied.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
