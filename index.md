title: Instructor Training
---
This short training course introduces the basics of educational psychology and instructional design,
and shows them how to use them to teach programming to free-range adult learners.
It is necessarily shallow,
but we hope it will convince you that it's worth learning more.

Throughout,
it's important to remember what H.L. Mencken wrote almost a century ago:
"For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong."
People are complicated,
and no general rule applies to everyone all the time.
