This short training course introduces the basics of 
educational psychology and instructional design,
and shows them how to use them to teach programming to free-range adult learners.
Each lesson is composed of *theory of how people learn* or a *tool 
for teaching* (or sometimes both!), with a specific focus on applying these 
ideas and tools to computational  
instruction.  It is a necessarily shallow survey of these topics,
but we hope it will convince you that it's worth learning more.
