As a species, we know a lot about how brains learn, how effective
various teaching practices are, and how society's needs and
expectations shape how and how well we learn.  As individuals, though,
most people who teach at college and university either don't know this
knowledge exists, or haven't incorporated it into their teaching.

The goal of this short training course is to introduce people to the
basics of educational psychology and instructional design, and show
them how to use those ideas to teach programming to free-range adult
learners.  We can only touch a few scattered highlights, but we hope
that will be enough to convince you that it's worth learning more.

Throughout, it's important to remember what H.L. Mencken wrote almost
a century ago: "For every complex problem there is an answer that is
clear, simple, and wrong."  People are complicated, and no general
rule applies to everyone and all the time.  You should always use your
own best judgment when applying the ideas discussed below to your
learners.
