title: Instructor Training
---
This short training course introduces the basics of educational
psychology and instructional design, and shows them how to use them to
teach programming to free-range adult learners.  Each lesson is
composed of *theory of how people learn* or a *tool for teaching* (or
sometimes both!), with a specific focus on applying these ideas and
tools to computational instruction.  It is a necessarily shallow
survey of these topics, but we hope it will convince you that it's
worth learning more.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> There are no specific prerequisites for this training,
> but participants will benefit from having been through
> a Data Carpentry or Software Carpentry workshop
> so that they are familiar with our teaching techniques.
