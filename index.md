Over the last hundred years,
researchers have discovered an enormous amount about how people learn
and how best to teach them.
Unfortunately,
much of that knowledge has not yet been translated into common classroom practice,
while many myths about education have proven remarkably persistent.

This two-day class has two goals: 
* Introduce participants to a handful of key research findings
and show how they can be used to help people learn better and faster.
* Introduce participants to the teaching practices that have been adopted by 
the Software and Data Carpentry communities, and the overall philosophy 
and procedures of both organizations
in order to prepare them to teach at Software and Data Carpentry workshops.  

To accomplish the first goal, we will look at
the cognitive differences between novices, competent practitioners, and experts;
why those differences require different pedagogical approaches;
how to design formative assessments to provide feedback to both instructors and students while learning is taking place;
how to mitigate cognitive load during learning;
how concept maps can be used both to design lessons and to communicate those designs;
how practices similar to pair programming and test-driven design can be used in education;
and how teaching is a performance art.

To accomplish the second, we will practice live-coding, discuss the logistics 
of setting up and running a workshop, and otherwise orient participants to the 
structure of the Data and Software Carpentry organizations.  

The class will be hands-on throughout: short lessons 
will alternate with individual and group practical exercises,
including practice teaching sessions.
Those who complete the two full days
and [some short follow-up exercises online]({{ site.root }}/checkout/)
will be certified to teach [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }})
and/or [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}).

*   All participants in this course are required to abide by our [code of conduct][conduct].
*   There are no specific prerequisites for this training,
    but participants will benefit from having been through a Data Carpentry or Software Carpentry workshop
    so that they are familiar with our teaching techniques.

[Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) has run variations on this course 
since 2012 for over 500 people, and the current material reflects the latest 
iteration of an ongoing process to refine what new instructors need to know.  
Note that despite the emphasis on Software and Data Carpentry in the curriculum, 
the present material is relevant to anyone trying to teach basic 
programming skills to adults.
