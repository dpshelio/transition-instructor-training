## Pace and Level

Given the diversity of our learners' backgrounds and skills, we will
always have a mix of more and less advanced people in our classes.  No
matter what we teach, and how fast or how slow we go, 20% or more of
the room will be lost, and there's a good chance that a different 20%
will be bored.

The obvious solution is to split people by level,
but if we ask them how much they know about particular things,
they regularly under- or over-estimate their knowledge.
We have therefore developed a short pre-assessment questionnaire
that asks them how easily they could do a small number of specific tasks.
It gives instructors some idea of who they're going to be helping,
but we have not validated the questions,
i.e.,
we have not done the laborious work of interviewing respondents
to ensure that they are interpreting the questions the same way that we are.
We also have not yet done the follow-up to see
whether the questionnaires' categorization of learners
matches their actual in-class proficiency.

> the less accurate their estimate of their knowledge is.

That said, there *are* things we can do:

*   Before running a workshop,
    communicate its level clearly to everyone who's thinking of signing up
    by listing the topics that will be covered
    and showing a few examples of exercises that people will be asked to complete.
*   Provide multiple exercises for each teaching episode
    so that more advanced learners don't finish early and get bored.
*   Ask more advanced learners to help people next to them.
    They'll learn from answering their peers' questions
    (since it will force them to think about things in new ways).
*   The helpers and the instructor who isn't teaching the particular episode
    should keep an eye out for learners who are falling behind
    and intervene early
    so that they don't become frustrated and give up.

The most important thing is to accept that
no class can possibly meet everyone's individual needs.
If the instructor slows down to accommodate two people who are struggling,
the other 38 are not being well served.
Equally,
if she spends a few minutes talking about an advanced topic because two learners are bored,
the 38 who don't understand it will feel left out.
All we can do is tell our learners what we're doing and why,
and hope that they'll understand.

## Workshop Operations

Starting in January 2015 we began running bi-weekly debriefing
sessions for instructors who have recently taught workshops.  In
these, instructors discuss what they actually did, how it worked, how
the lessons they actually delivered differed from our templates, what
problems arose, and so on.

Summaries are posted on our blog shortly after each meeting.
More importantly,
we have condensed this feedback (and much else)
in an [operations guide](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/operations.html)
and a set of checklists
that describes what everyone in a workshop is expected to do and why.

> ## Feedback on Assessment
>
> Go through the pre-assessment questionnaire given to you by your instructor
> and critique its questions.
> (Remember, critiquing means commenting on positive aspects as well as negative ones.)
> How long do you think it will take the average learner to fill it in?
> How useful do you think the information it gathers will be to you as an instructor?
> How could you improve the questions?
> What would you add, and what would you drop to make room?
