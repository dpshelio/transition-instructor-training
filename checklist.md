## Scheduling the Event

1.  Decide if it will be in person, online for one site, or online for several.
1.  Talk through expectations with the host(s).
    *   If it is in person, make sure the host knows they're covering travel costs for trainers.
    *   Determine who is allowed to attend.
        *   We strongly prefer trainees to have attended workshops (as learners or helpers).
        *   Other criteria may be negotiated by the Executive Directors as part of partnership agreements.
1.  Create a placeholder event in AMY.
1.  Arrange trainers.
1.  Arrange space.
    *   Make sure there are breakout rooms for video recording.
1.  Choose dates.
    *   If it is in person, book travel.
1.  Get names and email addresses of attendees from host(s) and add them to AMY.
    *   Remember to add the instructors as well.
1.  Contact other trainers to see who will be available to run lesson demonstration sessions.
    (In general, trainers should not do final certification of people they have trained.)

## Setting Up

1.  Set up a one-page website for the workshop by importing content from
    [the instructor training session template](https://github.com/swcarpentry/instructor-training-session-template).
    (Note that we have to use import rather than fork for the same reasons we do with websites for regular workshops.)
1.  Send the URL for the website to the admins,
    or add it to AMY directly.
1.  Create an Etherpad and add its link to the website.
1.  Check whether any attendees have special needs.
1.  If there are online participants:
    *   Test the video conference link.
    *   Make sure that everyone agrees on the start time (including time zones).
1.  Make sure attendees will all have network access.
1.  Email attendees `messages/welcome.txt` from this repository
    with changes and additions to reflect the workshop's date, website URL, etc.

## During the Event

1.  Remind everyone of the code of conduct.
1.  Collect attendance.
1.  Distribute sticky notes.
1.  Collect participants' GitHub IDs.
    *   Get these even if they are focused on Data Carpentry
        because they are now asked to submit material to Data Carpentry lessons by creating GitHub issues.
1.  Go through the [checkout procedure](checkout.html).

## After the Event

1.  Email attendees `messages/checkout.txt` from this repository
    with changes and additions to reflect the workshop's date, website URL, etc.
1.  Recruit experienced instructors to lead lesson discussion sessions
    *or*
    contact the leaders of the workshop debriefing sessions to let them know
    that some trainees are headed their way.
1.  Contact other trainers to see who is available to run lesson demonstration sessions when.
1.  Give new instructors badges in AMY.
1.  Create and send [PDF certificates](https://github.com/swcarpentry/certification/).
1.  Debrief with the head of instructor training.
