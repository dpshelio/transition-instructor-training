## Checkout Procedure

1.  Trainee chooses one of the core lessons from each Carpentry she is qualifying for.
1.  Trainee submits an exercise as a pull request (Software Carpentry) or to a Google Doc (Data Carpentry).
    *   Exercise does not have to be accepted in order for trainee to proceed.
1.  Trainee takes part in an hour-long discussion session about that lesson.
    *   If the discussion leader feels that the trainee has not adequately prepared for the discussion session,
        she may require the trainee to come back and attend another one.
1.  Trainee teaches a 5-minute segment from her chosen lesson.
    *   Segment is chosen at the time of examination by the trainer overseeing the session.
    *   This ensures that trainees will prepare the whole lesson.
    *   If the trainer feels the trainee is not yet ready to teach in front of a class,
        she may require the trainee to try again.

Trainers do not examine their own trainees:
having them examine each other's helps balance load
and maintain consistency of curriculum and standards.
