Hello everyone, and thank you for signing up for our upcoming instructor training session. In order to prepare:

1.  Please read Success in Introductory Programming: What Works? (http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/papers/porter-what-works-2013.pdf), Why Is It So Hard to Learn to Program? (http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/papers/guzdial-why-hard-to-teach-2011.pdf), and Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned (http://f1000research.com/articles/3-62/v2).

2.  Please go to the Software Carpentry lessons page (http://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) and the Data Carpentry lessons page (http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/) to have a look at what we currently teach in Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry respectively. You are *not* expected to go through these in detail --- we'll do a walk-through in class --- but it would be helpful if you knew what the major topics are.

3.  We will be recording one another teaching in pairs or threes during the class, so please bring a cell phone or hand-held camera that can record audio and video. It doesn't have to be high-quality, but it should be good enough that you can understand what someone is saying.

If you have any questions about this, the reading material, or anything else, please mail us, and we will respond as quickly as we can.

thanks again,
Greg

p.s. if you're interested in doing more reading, you may enjoy:

* How Learning Works (http://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Jossey-Bass/dp/0470484101/), which is an excellent summary of current research in teaching and learning

* Building a Better Teacher (http://www.amazon.com/Building-Better-Teacher-Teaching-Everyone/dp/0393081591/), a well-written look at why educational reforms in the past 50 years have mostly missed the mark and about what we should be doing instead.

* Teaching What You Don't Know (http://www.amazon.com/Teaching-What-You-Dont-Know/dp/0674066170/), which is a situation many of us find ourselves in more often that we'd like.
