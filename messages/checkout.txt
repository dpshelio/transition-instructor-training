Hi everyone,

Thanks again for taking part in instructor training this week. In order to wrap up, we would like you to do the steps outlined in http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/checkout.html:

1. Submit something for one of our lessons.

2. Take part in an online discussion session.

3. Teach a 5-minute demonstration lesson online.

If you have any questions or suggestions about these steps, please contact your trainer or mail us at training-help@software-carpentry.org.  Please note that we would like everyone to complete all three steps within 90 days of the training course.  If you are not able to do this, please contact your trainer to discuss reasons and options.

Thanks again - we look forward to seeing you online.
