# Guidelines for Checkout Discussion Sessions

This document outlines some things that can be discussed during the
checkout discussion sessions.  The sessions are meant to be
student-driven, but some groups may be quieter than others.  This is
by no means an exhaustive list: other subjects are bound to come up,
and additions from discussion leaders are very welcome.

The purpose of the discussion session is for students to ask questions
about the lesson materials in preparation for their final checkout.
The discussion lead's role is to give context to the lesson material,
as each lesson goes through many revisions and discussions that cannot
be easily seen in the finished product.

**Note:** trainees do **not** do their 5-minute demonstration lessons
during the discussion sessions.  Instead, once they have completed the
discussion to the leader's satisfaction, their names should be
forwarded to their trainer so that the demonstration lesson can be
scheduled.

## Before:

*   A signup Etherpad will be sent out to trainees, who choose their
    subject and sign up for a session.

*   All meetings should use the Etherpad that is being used to register
    for discussion sessions, so that all comments and feedback are
    collected in one document.

*   The discussion lead is free to use the Software Carpentry persistent
    BlueJeans connection, or other options such as Google Hangouts or
    Skype if they prefer.  The lead must post information about the
    connection to the discussion session's Etherpad so that people
    will know how to join.

## During:

*   Remind students that the Etherpad is a public, persistent document,
    and that ideas and issues from the Etherpad may be used by the SCF.

*   Explain how the checkout procedure itself goes:

    *   After the trainee has completed the discussion session to the discussion leader's satisfaction,
        the leader will forward her name to the trainer.

    *   The trainer will then schedule a 5-minute slot for a demonstration lesson
        and communicate it to the trainee.

    *   In that session,
        the trainee will be asked to teach 5 minutes from her chosen lesson
        selected by the trainer.
        The trainee will *not* know in advance which 5 minutes she will be asked to teach
        (which encourages her to prepare the entire lesson).

    *   Everyone will be notified afterwards by email whether they
        passed or not.

*   Make sure that all know where the lesson material can be found.
    Ensure that they all know about the instructor guide.

*   Discuss the fact that the lesson material is under continous
    development.  Tell the students that any and all changes to the
    lesson material that might improve on it is welcome.  If anybody
    has any comments on the material, they are very welcome.

*   Go through each of the modules in the lesson and ask if anybody has
    any problems, questions, or comments about the module.  This
    walkthrough is particulary important if any of the participants
    are on the quieter side.

*   It is important that we ensure that all of the participants get to
    discuss their issues.  In cases where all participants are vocal,
    a structured walkthrough may not be necessary.

## After:

*   If any of the participants seemed unprepared (.e.g, had no
    questions), send them an email after the session asking them to
    sign up for another discussion session.

*   Report to the trainers the people who were in your session, and
    whether you deemed them ready to go forth to the checkout session.
