# Guidelines for Checkout Discussion Sessions

This document outlines some things that can be discussed during the
checkout discussion sessions.  The sessions are meant to be
student-driven, but some groups may be quieter than others.  This is
by no means an exhaustive list: other subjects are bound to come up,
and additions from discussion leaders are very welcome.

## Beforehand:

*   All meetings should use the Etherpad that is being used to register
    for discussion sessions, so that all comments and feedback are
    collected in one document.

*   The discussion lead is free to use the Software Carpentry persistent
    BlueJeans connection, or other options such as Google Hangouts or
    Skype if they prefer.  The lead must post information about the
    connection to the discussion session's Etherpad so that people
    will know how to join.

## During:

*   Remind students that the Etherpad is a public, persistent document,
    and that ideas and issues from the Etherpad may be used by the SCF.

*   Explain how the checkout procedure itself goes:

    *   A signup Etherpad will be sent out.  Choose your subject and
        sign up for a session.

    *   Around 5 people gather on a hangout with one of the trainers.
        Each person will have 5 minutes to present a section of the
        material.  The trainer will dictate which material from the
        lesson the student is to present.

    *   Please note that the student is expected to be able to teach
        with little to no reference to the material during these 5
        minutes.

    *   After the presentation, there will be 5 minutes for feedback
        from the trainer and the other participants.

    *   Everyone will be notified afterwards by email whether they
        passed or not.

*   Make sure that all know where the lesson material can be found.
    Ensure that they all know about the instructor guide.

*   Discuss the fact that the lesson material is under continous
    development.  Tell the students that any and all changes to the
    lesson material that might improve on it is welcome.  If anybody
    has any comments on the material, they are very welcome.

*   Go through each of the modules in the lesson and ask if anybody has
    any problems, questions, or comments about the module.  This
    walkthrough is particulary important if any of the participants
    are on the quieter side.

*   It is important that we ensure that all of the participants get to
    discuss their issues.  In cases where all participants are vocal,
    a structured walkthrough may not be necessary.

## After:

*   If any of the participants seemed unprepared (.e.g, had no
    questions), send them an email after the session asking them to
    sign up for another discussion session.

*   Report to the trainers the people who were in your session, and
    whether you deemed them ready to go forth to the checkout session.
