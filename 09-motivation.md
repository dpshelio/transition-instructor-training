## Motivation

People learn best when they care about the topic and believe they can master it.
This presents us with a problem
because most scientists don't want to program:
they want to do science,
and rightly regarding programming as a tax they have to pay in order to do so.
In addition,
their early experiences with programming are often demoralizing,
and believing that something will be hard to learn is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Imagine a grid whose axes are labelled "mean time to master" and "usefulness once mastered".
Everything that's quick to master, and immediately useful should be taught first;
things in the opposite corner
that are hard to learn and have little near-term application
don't belong in this course.

> ## Actual Time

> Any useful estimate of how long something takes to master must take into account
> how frequent failures are

> For example,

Many of the foundational concepts of computer science,
such as computability,
inhabit the "useful but hard to learn" corner of the grid described above.
This doesn't mean that they aren't worth learning,
but if our aim is to convince people that they *can* learn this stuff,
and that doing so will help them do more science faster,
they are less compelling than things like automating repetitive tasks.

We have therefore adopted a "teach most immediately useful first" approach.
We try to have learners do something that *they* think is useful in their daily work
within 15 minutes of starting each lesson.
This not only motivates them,
it also helps build their confidence in us,
so that if it takes longer to get to the payoff of a later topic,
they'll stick with us.

Perhaps the best-studied use of this idea is
the *[media computation](papers/guzdial-mediacomp-retrospective-2013.pdf)* approach
developed by Guzdial and Ericson at Georgia Tech.
Instead of printing "hello world" or summing the first ten integers,
their students' first program opens an image,
resizes it to create at thumbnail,
and saves the result.
This is an *authentic task*,
i.e.,
something that learners believe they would actually do in real life.
It is also *tangible*:
if the image comes out the wrong size,
learners have a concrete starting point for debugging.

## Strategies for Motivating Learners

*[How Learning Works](http://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Jossey-Bass/dp/0470484101/)*
contains this list of evidence-based methods to motivate learners.
None of them are surprising ---
it's hard to imagine someone saying that we *shouldn't* identify and reward what we value ---
but it's useful to check lessons against these points
to make sure they're doing at least a few of these things.

*   Strategies to establish value:
    1.  Connect the material to students' interests.
    2.  Provide authentic, real-world tasks.
    3.  Show relevance to students' current academic lives.
    4.  Demonstrate the relevance of higher-level skills to students' future professional lives.
    5.  Identify and reward what you value.
    6.  Show your own passion and enthusiasm for the discipline.
*   Strategies to build positive expectations:
    1.  Ensure alignment of objectives, assessments, and instructional strategies.
    2.  Identify an appropriate level of challenge.
    3.  Create assignments that provide the appropriate level of challenge.
    4.  Provide early success opportunities.
    5.  Articulate your expectations.
    6.  Provide rubrics.
    7.  Provide targeted feedback.
    8.  Be fair.
    9.  Educate students about the ways we explain success and failure.
    10. Describe effective study strategies.
*   Strategies for self-efficacy:
    1.  Provide flexibility and control.
    2.  Give students an opportunity to reflect.

## Greg's Story

When I first started teaching at the University of Toronto,
students occasionally asked me why I was doing it for free.
This was my answer:

> When I was your age,
> I thought universities existed to teach people how to learn.
> Later,
> in grad school,
> I thought universities were about doing research and creating new knowledge.
> Now that I'm in my forties,
> though,
> I've realized that what we're really teaching you is
> how to take over the world,
> because you're going to have to one day
> whether you like it or not.
>
> My parents are in their seventies.
> They don't run the world any more;
> it's people my age who pass laws, set interest rates,
> and make life-and-death decisions in hospitals.
> As scary as it may be,
> *we've* become the grownups.
>
> Twenty years from now,
> though,
> we'll be heading for retirement and *you* will be in charge,
> because there won't be anyone else to do it.
> That may sound like a long time when you're nineteen,
> but let me tell you,
> take three breaths and it's gone.
> That's why we give you problems
> whose answers can't be cribbed from last year's notes.
> That's why we put you in situations
> where you have to figure out what needs to be done right now,
> what can be left for later,
> and what you can simply ignore.
> It's because if you don't start learning how to do these things now,
> you won't be ready to do them when you have to.

It was stirring stuff,
but it wasn't the whole story.
I didn't just want my students to make the world a better place
so that I could retire in comfort.
I want them to make it a better place because
it's the great adventure of our time.
Just think:
a hundred and fifty years ago,
most societies still practiced slavery.
A hundred years ago,
when my grandmother was young,
she [wasn't legally a person](http://www.canuck.com/famous5/html/history.html) in Canada.
Fifty years ago,
most of the world's people suffered under totalitarian rule;
in the year I was born,
judges could---and did---order electroshock therapy to "cure" homosexuals.
Yes,
there's still a lot wrong with the world,
but look at how many more choices we have than our grandparents did.
Look at how many more things we can know,
and be,
and enjoy.
And most importantly,
look at how many other people can too.

This didn't happen by chance.
It happened because millions of us made millions of little decisions,
the sum of which was a better world.
We don't think of these day-to-day decisions as political,
but every time we buy one brand of running shoe instead of another
or shout an anatomical insult instead of a racial one at a cab driver,
we're choosing one vision of the world instead of another.
We don't think about this bigger picture most of the time,
but the last century and a half shows that
once enough people make "doing the right thing" a habit,
the big picture more or less takes care of itself.

At leats,
that's what I believed ten years ago.
I am less optimistic today.
Faced with catastrophic climate change,
many of my generation have chosen to argue away evidence
rather than fix things while they can still be fixed.
The bill for our cowardice and lethargy many not come due until my daughter is grown,
but come due it will,
and with heavy interest;
the only things that will save us then will be more science and more courage.
Teaching scientists to change the way they work,
and to pay as much attention to research on teaching
as they would like society to pay to things that really matter,
is just practice.

In his 1947 essay
[Why I Write](http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/whywrite.html),
George Orwell said:

> In a peaceful age I might have written ornate or merely descriptive books,
> and might have remained almost unaware of my political loyalties.
> As it is I have been forced into becoming a sort of pamphleteer...
> Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written,
> directly or indirectly,
> against totalitarianism...
> It seems to me nonsense,
> in a period like our own,
> to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects.
> Everyone writes of them in one guise or another.
> It is simply a question of which side one takes...

Replace "writing" with "teaching" and you'll have the reason
I've done what I've done for the last eleven years.
The world doesn't get better on its own.
It gets better because people *make* it better:
penny by penny,
vote by vote,
and one lesson at a time.
