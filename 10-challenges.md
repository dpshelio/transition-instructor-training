## Workshop Operations

Starting in January 2015 we began running bi-weekly debriefing
sessions for instructors who have recently taught workshops.  In
these, instructors discuss what they actually did, how it worked, how
the lessons they actually delivered differed from our templates, what
problems arose, and so on.

Summaries are posted on our blog shortly after each meeting.
More importantly,
we have condensed this feedback (and much else)
in an [operations guide](http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/operations.html)
and a set of checklists
that describes what everyone in a workshop is expected to do and why.

> ## Feedback on Assessment
>
> Go through the pre-assessment questionnaire given to you by your instructor
> and critique its questions.
> (Remember, critiquing means commenting on positive aspects as well as negative ones.)
> How long do you think it will take the average learner to fill it in?
> How useful do you think the information it gathers will be to you as an instructor?
> How could you improve the questions?
> What would you add, and what would you drop to make room?

> ## Assessing Ourselves
>
> We believe that our workshops make researchers more productive.
> If you were a skeptical department chair,
> what would you accept as proof of this?
>
> 1.  Testimonials volunteered by workshop learners are suspect
>     because they are opt-in (people who didn't get anything
>     out of it are less likely to respond than people who did)
>     and because self-assessment is unreliable.
> 2.  Measuring uptake of tools like GitHub is suspect because
>     people might adopt other things instead, and because
>     we would then need to prove that using version control
>     actually makes someone more productive as a researcher
>     (a claim that that is plausible but unproven).
> 3.  Comparing the publication and citation rates of workshop
>     participants (the treatment group) with non-participants
>     (the control group) will take years, and may confuse
>     correlation with causation, since the people who take
>     our workshops might be intrinsically more highly
>     motivated or skilled than those who don't.
>
> Work in small groups to develop and critique other assessments
> that you think would pass the "skeptical chair" test.
