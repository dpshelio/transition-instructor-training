What should be covered in an instructor training?  What is involved in 
"becoming an instructor"?  

Introduces ideas about how people learn, how we design lessons, real teaching 
practices, and what it means to learn to teach.  

Focus on three core areas:
- Learners: how do people learn?
- Lessons: Knowing how people learn, how do we prepare 
to teach?  What practices do we use in the classroom?  
- Instructors: what do teachers need to know or do to "become" teachers, or improve 
their skills?

applications for the above.  There are several topics (models, maps, faded) 
that discuss how people learn and then how to apply 
Final topic of the day, more general ideas of lesson design.  Interspersed 
throughout the day is the message of lesson study - learning how to teach, 
receive feedback, and 

The second day of topics delves into Software Carpentry/Data Carpentry specific 
practices and the "personal" side of teaching - the importance of motivation 
(and lack of demotivation!), why we teach, and how teaching is a personal performance.
