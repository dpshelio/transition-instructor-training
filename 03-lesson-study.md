## Lesson Study

Many people assume that teachers are born, not made.
From politicians to researchers and teachers themselves,
most reformers have designed systems to find and promote those who can teach
and eliminate those who can't.
As Elizabeth Green describes in
*[Building a Better Teacher](http://www.amazon.com/Building-Better-Teacher-Teaching-Everyone/dp/0393081591/)*,
though,
that assumption is wrong,
which is why educational reforms based on it have repeatedly failed.

The book is written as a history of the people who have put that puzzle together in the US.
Its core begins with a discussion of what James Stigler discovered during a visit to Japan in the early 1990s:

> Some American teachers called their pattern "I, We, You":
> After checking homework,
> teachers announced the day's topic,
> demonstrating a new procedure (I)...
> Then they led the class in trying out a sample problem together (We)...
> Finally, they let students work through similar problems on their own,
> usually by silently making their way through a worksheet (You)...
>
> The Japanese teachers, meanwhile, turned "I, We, You" inside out.
> You might call their version "You, Y'all, We."
> They began not with an > introduction,
> but a single problem that students spent ten or twenty > minutes working through alone (You)...
> While the students worked,
> the teacher wove through the students' desks,
> studying what they came up with and taking notes to remember who had which idea.
> Sometimes the teacher then deployed the students to discuss the problem in small > groups (Y'all).
> Next, the teacher brought them back to the whole group,
> asking students to present their different ideas for how to solve the problem on the chalkboard...
> Finally, the teacher led a discussion,
> guiding students to a shared conclusion (We).

It's tempting but wrong to think that this particular teaching technique is Japan's secret sauce.
The actual key is revealed in the description of Akihiko Takahashi's work.
In 1991,
he visited the United States in a vain attempt to find the classrooms described a decade earlier
in a report by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.
He couldn't find them.
Instead, he found that American teachers met once a year (if that) to exchange ideas about teaching,
compared to the weekly or even daily meetings he was used to.
What was worse:

> The teachers described lessons they gave and things students said,
> but they did not *see* the practices.
> When it came to observing actual lessons --- watching each other teach ---
> they simply had no opportunity...
> They had, he realized, no *jugyokenkyu*.
> Translated literally as "lesson study",
> *jugyokenkyu* is a bucket of practices that Japanese teachers use to hone their craft,
> from observing each other at work to discussing the lesson afterward
> to studying curriculum materials with colleagues.
> The practice is so pervasive in Japanese schools that it is...effectively invisible.
>
> And here lay the answer to [Akihiko's] puzzle.
> Of course the American teachers' work fell short of the model set by their best thinkers...
> Without *jugyokenkyu*, his own classes would have been equally drab.
> Without *jugyokenkyu*, how could you even teach?

So what does *jugyokenkyu* look like in practice?

> In order to graduate,
> education majors not only had to watch their assigned master teacher work,
> they had to effectively replace him,
> installing themselves in his classroom first as observers and then,
> by the third week, as a wobbly...approximation of the teacher himself.
> It worked like a kind of teaching relay.
> Each trainee took a subject,

> the architecture of the group discussion.

> "*Many* people."
> After all, it was his mentor...who had taught him the new approach to teaching...
> And [he] had crafted the approach along with the other math teachers
> in [his ward] and beyond.
> Together, the group met regularly to discuss their plans for teaching...
> [At] the end of a discussion,
> they'd invite each other to their classrooms to study the results.
> In retrospect,
> this was the most important lesson:

> using the cycle of *jugyokenkyu* to put...work under a microscope and improve it.

Putting work under a microscope in order to improve it is commonplace in sports and music.
A professional musician, for example,
will dissect half a dozen different recordings of "Body and Soul" or "Smells Like Teen Spirit" before performing it.
They would also expect to get feedback from fellow musicians during practice and after performances.
Many other disciplines work this way too:
the Japanese drew inspiration from [Deming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming)'s ideas
on continuous improvement in manufacturing,
while the adoption of code review over the last 15 years
has done more to improve everyday programming than any number of books or websites.

But this kind of feedback isn't part of teaching culture in English-language school systems:
in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, and elsewhere,
what happens in the classroom stays in the classroom.
Teachers don't watch each other's lessons on a regular basis,
so they can't borrow each other's good ideas.
The result is that *every teacher has to invent teaching on their own*.
They may get lesson plans and assignments from colleagues,
the school board,
a textbook publisher,
or the Internet,
but each teacher has to figure out on their own how to combine that with
the theory they've learned in education school
to deliver an actual lesson in an actual classroom for actual students.

Fincher and her colleagues studied how teaching practices are actually transferred
using both [a detailed case study](papers/fincher-warrens-question-2007.pdf)
and
[analysis of change stories](papers/fincher-stories-change-2012.pdf).
As the abstract of the latter paper says:

> Innovative tools and teaching practices often fail to be adopted by educators in the field,
> despite evidence of their effectiveness.
> NaÃ¯ve models of educational change assume this lack of adoption arises from
> failure to properly disseminate promising work,
> but evidence suggests that dissemination via publication is simply not effective...
> We asked educators to describe changes they had made to their teaching practice
> and analyzed the resulting stories...
> Of the 99 change stories analyzed,
> only three demonstrate an active search for new practices or materials on the part of teachers,
> and published materials were consulted in just eight of the stories.
> Most of the changes occurred locally,
> without input from outside sources,
> or involved only personal interaction with other educators.

This is part of the reason for Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry's rule,
"Never teach alone."
Having another instructor in the classroom saves your voice
(it's hard to talk for two days straight),
but more importantly,
it's a chance for instructors to learn from one another.
