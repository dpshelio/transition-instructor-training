This page outlines the design of the whole course and each lesson.
It follows the "Understanding by Design" template (very) loosely.

## Overall

1.  Desired Results
    *   Know that education research exists and where to find it.
    *   Believe that teaching practices should be based on evidence.
    *   Be familiar with a few key research results.
    *   Use a few evidence-based practices when teaching SWC/DC.
    *   Take part in informed discussion about teaching practices with peers.
2.  Evidence
    *   Describe key research results and explain how to apply them in class.
    *   Use evidence-based practices in SWC/DC classes.
    *   Use jargon correctly to describe and critique their own teaching.
    *   Contribute to SWC/DC discussions and lessons.
    *   Take part in studies of SWC/DC.
3.  Learning Plan
    1.  Use formative assessment to set pace of lessons that help novices form usable mental models.
    2.  Use concept maps to set learning goals, then work backward to summative assessments and scaffolded exercises.

## Mental Models

1.  Desired Results
    *   Understand scopes of educational psychology and instructional design.
    *   Understand difference between "novice" and "competent" practitioner.
    *   Understand different levels of misconceptions and how (not) to address each.
    *   Understand contrasting purposes of summative and formative assessment.
2.  Evidence
    *   Create an MCQ whose distractors have diagnostic power.
    *   Explain a common misconception and how to get learners to confront it.
    *   Describe another kind of formative assessment you have seen and explain it in psychological terms.
3.  Learning Plan
    *   Distinguish educational psychology from instructional design.
        *   Introduce broader perspectives than our cognitive approach.
    *   Explain novice-competent-expert model of cognitive development.
        *   Emphasize importance of helping novices develop workable mental model.
    *   Distinguish three levels of misconception: we focus on the middle layer.
    *   Explain difference between formative and summative assessment.
    *   Show how to use MCQs as diagnostic tool.

## Logistic Requirements

This course has been taught in two primary formats - as a 2-day, in-person class 
and as an 8-week, online class.  

### Online Training

* Meeting space: Obviously, one of the primary logistic concerns for an online 
course is the online meeting space.  For this instructor training, we have primarily 
used a voice/video system like Google Hangouts or BlueJeans in conjunction with an 
etherpad.  
* Online platform for assignment submissions and discussion: There have been several 
incarnations of this training that used a wordpress-like blog, github, and currently 
Piazza for managing assignment submission and discussion.  

## In-Person Training

* Breakout rooms: At several points in the training, the participants are divided 
into small groups and tasked with a certain activity.  Since the activities may 
involve audio recording, it is best if each group can have their own space 
for breakouts.  
* Cameras / recording devices: participants should try to bring some kind of 
recording device (like a smartphone or camera) for certain class activities.
