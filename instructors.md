## Logistics

This course has been taught as a multi-week online class,
as a two-day in-person class,
and as a two-day class in which the learners are together in groups
and the instructor participates remotely.

### Online Training

*   Meeting space: we have primarily used a voice/video system like
    Google Hangouts or BlueJeans in conjunction with an Etherpad.
*   Online platform for assignment submissions and discussion: There
    have been several incarnations of this training that used a
    WordPress blog, GitHub, and Piazza for managing assignment
    submission and discussion.

## In-Person Training

*   Breakout rooms: At several points in the training, the participants are divided
    into small groups and tasked with a certain activity.  Since the activities may
    involve audio recording, it is best if each group can have their own space
    for breakouts.
*   Recording devices: participants should try to bring some kind of
    recording device (like a smartphone or camera) for live teaching
    exercises.
