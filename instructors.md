## Logistics

This course has been taught as a multi-week online class,
as a two-day in-person class,
and as a two-day class in which the learners are in co-located groups
and the instructor participates remotely.

### Multi-Week Online

This was the first method we tried.

*   We meet every week or every second week for an hour using Google Hangout or BlueJeans.
    Each meeting is held twice (or even three times) to accommodate learners' time zones
    and because video conferencing systems can't handle 60+ people at once.
    Each meeting also uses an Etherpad for shared note-taking,
    and more importantly for asking and answering questions:
    having several dozen people try to talk on a call hasn't worked,
    so in most sessions,
    the instructor does the talking
    and learners respond through the Etherpad chat.

*   Learners post homework online, then comment on each other's work.
    *   We used a WordPress blog for the first ten rounds of training.
        People found writing and commenting on posts straightforward,
	but setting up dozens of logins was tedious.
    *   We tried a GitHub-backed blog in the Winter 2015 class.
        It didn't work nearly as well:
	a third of the participants found it extremely frustrating,
	and post-publication commentary was awkward.
    *   We tried Piazza in the Fall 2015 class.
        It was better than GitHub,
	but still not as good as a simple WordPress blog.
	In particular,
	it was hard to find things once there were more than a dozen homework categories.

### Two-Day In-Person

This was the second method we tried.
The biggest change was the introduction of recorded teaching exercises.

*   Several times during the training,
    participants are divided into groups of three
    and asked to teach a short lesson (typically 2-3 minutes long).
    In turn,
    one person is the teacher, one the audience, and one the videographer,
    who records the teacher using a handheld device such as a phone.
    Group members then rotate roles:
    the teacher becomes the listener, the listener records, and the videographer teaches.
    Once all three have finished teaching,
    the group reviews all three videos,
    and everyone gives feedback on everyone (including themselves).
    This feedback then goes into the Etherpad for discussion.

*   It's important to record all three videos and then watch all three:
    if the cycle is teach-review-teach-review,
    the last person to teach runs out of time.
    Doing all the reviewing after all the teaching
    also helps put a bit of distance between the teaching and the reviewing,
    which makes the exercise slightly less excruciating.

*   This exercise only works if there are breakout rooms available:
    if everyone is trying to record in the same room,
    the audio cross-talk makes the recordings unintelligible.

*   We use Etherpad for in-person training,
    both for note-taking and for posting exercise solutions and feedback on recorded lessons
    Questions and discussion are done aloud.

### Two-Day Online With Groups

*   We use Google Hangouts and Etherpad as in the multi-week version.
    Each group of learners is together in a room using one camera and microphone,
    rather than each being on the call separately.
    We have found that having good audio matters more than having good video,
    and that the better the audio,
    the more learners can communicate with the instructor and other rooms by voice
    rather than by using the Etherpad chat.

*   We do the video lecture exercise as in the two-day in-person training.

## Exercises

*   Learners do think-pair-share for cognitive maps and MCQs.

*   In the two-day versions,
    have learners read the operations guide as their overnight homework
    and do their demotivational story just before lunch on day 2:
    it means day 2 starts with *their* questions (which wakes them up),
    and the demotivational story is a good lead-in to lunchtime discussion.

*   Don't have them complete the Teaching Perspectives Inventory
    or read through the pre- or post-assessment questionnaires in class:
    it kills momentum.

*   Have them work in pairs for the live coding exercise rather than threes,
    and don't bother recording:
    the camera can't pick up both the speaker's body language and what's on the screen.

## Testimonials

### Greg Wilson

When I first started teaching at the University of Toronto,
students occasionally asked me why I was doing it for free.
This was my answer:

> When I was your age,
> I thought universities existed to teach people how to learn.
> Later,
> in grad school,
> I thought universities were about doing research and creating new knowledge.
> Now that I'm in my forties,
> though,
> I've realized that what we're really teaching you is
> how to take over the world,
> because you're going to have to one day
> whether you like it or not.
>
> My parents are in their seventies.
> They don't run the world any more;
> it's people my age who pass laws, set interest rates,
> and make life-and-death decisions in hospitals.
> As scary as it may be,
> *we've* become the grownups.
>
> Twenty years from now,
> though,
> we'll be heading for retirement and *you* will be in charge,
> because there won't be anyone else to do it.
> That may sound like a long time when you're nineteen,
> but let me tell you,
> take three breaths and it's gone.
> That's why we give you problems
> whose answers can't be cribbed from last year's notes.
> That's why we put you in situations
> where you have to figure out what needs to be done right now,
> what can be left for later,
> and what you can simply ignore.
> It's because if you don't start learning how to do these things now,
> you won't be ready to do them when you have to.

It was stirring stuff,
but it wasn't the whole story.
I didn't just want my students to make the world a better place
so that I could retire in comfort.
I want them to make it a better place because
it's the great adventure of our time.
Just think:
a hundred and fifty years ago,
most societies still practiced slavery.
A hundred years ago,
when my grandmother was young,
she [wasn't legally a person](http://www.canuck.com/famous5/html/history.html) in Canada.
Fifty years ago,
most of the world's people suffered under totalitarian rule;
in the year I was born,
judges could---and did---order electroshock therapy to "cure" homosexuals.
Yes,
there's still a lot wrong with the world,
but look at how many more choices we have than our grandparents did.
Look at how many more things we can know,
and be,
and enjoy.
And most importantly,
look at how many other people can too.

This didn't happen by chance.
It happened because millions of us made millions of little decisions,
the sum of which was a better world.
We don't think of these day-to-day decisions as political,
but every time we buy one brand of running shoe instead of another
or shout an anatomical insult instead of a racial one at a cab driver,
we're choosing one vision of the world instead of another.
We don't think about this bigger picture most of the time,
but the last century and a half shows that
once enough people make "doing the right thing" a habit,
the big picture more or less takes care of itself.

At leats,
that's what I believed ten years ago.
I am less optimistic today.
Faced with catastrophic climate change,
many of my generation have chosen to argue away evidence
rather than fix things while they can still be fixed.
The bill for our cowardice and lethargy many not come due until my daughter is grown,
but come due it will,
and with heavy interest;
the only things that will save us then will be more science and more courage.
Teaching scientists to change the way they work,
and to pay as much attention to research on teaching
as they would like society to pay to things that really matter,
is just practice.

In his 1947 essay
[Why I Write](http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/whywrite.html),
George Orwell said:

> In a peaceful age I might have written ornate or merely descriptive books,
> and might have remained almost unaware of my political loyalties.
> As it is I have been forced into becoming a sort of pamphleteer...
> Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written,
> directly or indirectly,
> against totalitarianism...
> It seems to me nonsense,
> in a period like our own,
> to think that one can avoid writing of such subjects.
> Everyone writes of them in one guise or another.
> It is simply a question of which side one takes...

Replace "writing" with "teaching" and you'll have the reason
I've done what I've done for the last eleven years.
The world doesn't get better on its own.
It gets better because people *make* it better:
penny by penny,
vote by vote,
and one lesson at a time.
