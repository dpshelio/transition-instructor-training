This page outlines the design of the whole course and each lesson.
It follows the "Understanding by Design" template (very) loosely.

## Overall

1.  Desired Results
    *   Know that education research exists and where to find it.
    *   Believe that teaching practices should be based on evidence.
    *   Be familiar with a few key research results.
    *   Use a few evidence-based practices when teaching SWC/DC.
    *   Take part in informed discussion about teaching practices with peers.
2.  Evidence
    *   Describe key research results and explain how to apply them in class.
    *   Use evidence-based practices in SWC/DC classes.
    *   Use jargon correctly to describe and critique their own teaching.
    *   Contribute to SWC/DC discussions and lessons.

3.  Learning Plan
    1.  Use formative assessment to set pace of lessons that help novices form usable mental models.
    2.  Use concept maps to set learning goals, then work backward to summative assessments and scaffolded exercises.

    *   Create an MCQ whose distractors have diagnostic power.
    *   Explain a common misconception and how to get learners to confront it.
    *   Describe another kind of formative assessment you have seen and explain it in psychological terms.
3.  Learning Plan
    *   Distinguish educational psychology from instructional design.
        *   Introduce broader perspectives than our cognitive approach.
    *   Explain novice-competent-expert model of cognitive development.
        *   Emphasize importance of helping novices develop workable mental model.
    *   Distinguish three levels of misconception: we focus on the middle layer.
