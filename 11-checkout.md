## Discussion session
You will be asked to join one of the discussion sessions (run as a video conference) focusing on the lesson of your choice from the Software and Data Carpentry curriculum. The session will be attended by a small group of instructor trainees like yourself and will be led by an experienced instructor. 

This is an informal discussion for trainees to get more comfortable with the training material, clarify anything that may be unclear, learn (if you are still unsure) how to provide feedback and contribute to the materials.

When working on the lesson, preparing for the discussion session, you can think about the following questions (which may also be used to structure the online discussion session):

1. When working through the lesson did you feel like you would like to change the flow / present the concepts differently? If so, which ones and why?
2. Was there anything that you found unclear in the material? Did you get stuck anywhere?
3. What are some misconceptions that the students could develop when learning this material? Which bits of the module may be tricky and if poorly explained, they may lead the students to broken mental model? 
4. What prior knowledge do learners need to have before participating in this module (whole lesson)?  If you were to list any prerequsites, what would they be? 

*Question 1* and *Question 2* should help instructor trainees get settled with the [collaborative lesson development approach](http://gvwilson.github.io/swctasks-website/blog/2014/03/collaborative-lesson-development.html) used by Software and Data Carpentry. Whilst it is natural that teaching from the material created by others may be a challenge at the beginning, it is worth to remember that these materials have been developed collaboratively, by a number of people with different perspectives. Hopefully, this allowed creating materials which are well balanced. The discussion session is an opportunity to clarify anything that you found confusing in the material, discuss the logical flow of the lessons and possible ways of delivering them. It actually is beneficial to all stakeholders involved in Software and Data Carpentry if  ["all of our instructors are (...) using our lessons rather than legacy material of their own."](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/01/eighteen-months-of-progress.html) 

At the discussion session we want to give you more confidence with the material.

*Question 3* at the the discussion session makes a reference back to our Instructor Training and helps you develop more awareness about possible "broken mental" models which students may have or may develop learning the particular module. 

*Question 4* refers back to the Instructor Training and helps you consider what is OK to assume about the prior knowledge for this module and what assumptions about learners knowledge should probably not be made.
