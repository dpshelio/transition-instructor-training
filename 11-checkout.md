{: .question}

The final steps in getting certified are as follows:

1. Pick one of the lessons we are currently accepting trainee requests on
   and submit a *small* change.
   (Your trainer will provide you with a list of lessons.)
   If you want to teach Software Carpentry,
   you must submit the change as a pull request on GitHub
   and send the link to your trainer.
   If you want to teach Data Carpentry,
   go to [its submission page][dc-submission-page]
   (which will redirect you to the appropriate place).

   Note:
   you may be allowed or encouraged to submit a change to a Data Carpentry lesson
   when qualifying as a Software Carpentry instructor---please
   check with your trainer for the current status of this.

2. Remember that lesson maintainers will be getting a number of pull requests like this,
   so take some time to write a good commit message
   so that the lesson maintainer understands what you're doing and why you think it's useful.
   For example:

   ~~~
   04-changes: Add a 'commit --amend' exercise

   Everybody will botch a commit message at some point.  This
   exercise introduces them to an easy way to fix those mistakes.
   ~~~

   (as both a commit message and a pull-request summary) will be a lot
   easier for the maintainer than:

   ~~~
   Instructor-training assignment
   ~~~

3. Pick one lesson from the core Software Carpentry lessons (if you
   wish to teach Software Carpentry) and/or one from the core Data
   Carpentry lessons (if you wish to teach Data Carpentry), and read
   through it/them carefully.

4. Sign up on the Etherpad indicated by your instructor to take part
   in an hour-long discussion session about the lessons you are going
   to use for your demo lesson (discussed below), and about the
   Carpentries in general.

   You are expected to be familiar with your chosen lesson(s) *before*
   this discussion session.  If the discussion leader feels you are
   not, you will encouraged to do more preparation and come back for a
   later discussion session.  If you are still unprepared, you will be
   asked to contact the header of instructor training to discuss
   reasons and options.

5. Once you've been through your discussion session, we will ask you
   to sign up for a 5-minute online demonstration lesson slot.  In
   that, we will ask you to teach a short segment of your chosen
   lesson(s): we'll tell you which segment on the day, so you'll have
   to be familiar with the whole lesson before we start.  Assuming
   that goes well, we will send you your certificate, add you to our
   roster, and get you on the dance floor.

Please note that:

1. You only have to do one lesson for a particular Carpentry in order
   to be certified as an instructor for it - if you qualify on one
   lesson, we'll trust you to familiarize yourself with others that
   you may want to teach.

2. Your exercise doesn't have to be accepted in order for you to
   become an instructor - the point of this exercise is to make sure
   that you understand the process and have met the people who review
   material.

3. We'd like to get everyone through this process within two months of
   training, so please get started as soon as you can.  Anyone who has
   not completed within three months should contact their trainer, or
   the head of instructor training, to discuss reasons and options.

## Discussion Sessions

Our discussion sessions are run as video conferences
and focus on the lesson of your choice from the Software and Data Carpentry curriculum.
Each session will be attended by a small group of instructor trainees like yourself
and will be led by an experienced instructor. 

This is an informal discussion for trainees to get more comfortable with the training material,
clarify anything that may be unclear,
and learn (if you are still unsure) how to provide feedback and contribute to the materials.

When preparing for the discussion session,
you can think about the following questions:

1. Did you feel like you would like to change the flow or present the concepts differently?
   If so, what and why?
2. Was there anything that you found unclear in the material?
   Did you get stuck anywhere?
3. What are some misconceptions that the students could develop when learning this material?
   Which bits of the module may be tricky and if poorly explained, they may lead the students to broken mental model? 
4. What prior knowledge do learners need to have before participating in this module (whole lesson)?
   If you were to list any prerequsites, what would they be? 

The first two questions are intended to help you become more comfortable with
[our collaborative lesson development methods]({{site.site}}/blog/2014/03/collaborative-lesson-development.html).
While teaching from the material created by others may be a challenge at the beginning,
these materials have been developed collaboratively by people just like you.

The third and fourth question refer back to the instructor training course,
and are meant to give you a chance to apply some of what you've learned to these specific lessons.
