I have the following two sentences written above my desk: 

Probe: Ask questions - what is someone's *real* problem?  
Persist: Solve the problem - go all the way to the end with someone.  

This is my reminder that my job is not primarily about *me* or a specific *tool* 
or *technique* - it's about researchers at my institution, and ultimately, their 
"science" - whether that be simulations of galaxies, delving into historical 
text corpora, or (something).  

I had the same insight after going through my first few rounds of instructor 
training and teaching in various settings.  My job as an instructor was not 
about *me* or specific *ideas* or *teaching techniques* - it was about the learners 
who had showed up that day.  

Obviously, as the teacher, it is my responsibility to manage myself, use techniques, 
and convey ideas, but that can only be done in a way that takes the learner 
into account first.  

In this training, the learner is also a potential instructor, which makes things unique.  
In constructing this training, we have tried to address what potential instructors 
need to teach well, and done so in a way that is maximally effective in conveying 
those ideas.  

What do potential instructors need to teach well?  We have assumed the following: 
- knowledge of how people learn
- knowledge and practice with lesson preparation
- practice teaching
- the chance to reflect on themselves, their teaching, and share with a community
