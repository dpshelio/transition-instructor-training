### What Kinds of Practice and Feedback Enhance Learning?

1.  Mismatched expectations can be difficult to diagnose and waste much time.
1.  In the absence of structure, learners tend to glide along more comfortable paths
    (i.e., making slides prettier rather than more content-rich).
1.  Deliberate practice without effective feedback can instill new unknown bad habits.
1.  Learning and performance are best fostered when students engage in practice that:
    1.  focuses on a specific goal or criterion for performance,
    1.  targets an appropriate level of challenge relative to studentsâ€™ current performance, and
    1.  is of sufficient quantity and frequency to meet the performance criteria.
1.  Articulate goals in measurable ways:
    1.  Use good metrics that relate to the objective and to possible performance from the learner.
    1.  Include higher-level goals.
1.  Concurrent learning can work, but often not at the novice skill level.
1.  While quality of practice matters, time on task is also important.
1.  Practice tends to be most effective at improving skills in the "competent" range.
    (Novices grapple with known knowns, competent practitioners with known unknowns, and experts with unknown unknowns.)
1.  Instructors should point out progress as it is made
    so that students recognize their accomplishment and discern the change in their behavior,
    especially when gradual.
1.  Grades and scores provide some information on the degree to which students' performance has met the criteria,
    they do not explain which aspects did or did not meet the criteria and how,
    so more specific feedback is necessary.
