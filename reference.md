## Papers

Mark Guzdial: "[Why Programming is Hard to Teach](http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/guzdial.pdf)".
:   A chapter from
    *[Making Software](http://www.amazon.com/Making-Software-Really-Works-Believe/dp/0596808321/)*
    that explores why programming seems so much harder to teach than
    some other standard subjects.  Instructors should also read
    [Guzdial's blog](http://computinged.wordpress.com) to keep up with
    new developments.
