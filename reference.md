### What Kinds of Practice and Feedback Enhance Learning?

1.  Mismatched expectations can be difficult to diagnose and waste much time.
1.  In the absence of structure, learners tend to glide along more comfortable paths
    (i.e., making slides prettier rather than more content-rich).
1.  Deliberate practice without effective feedback can instill new unknown bad habits.
1.  Learning and performance are best fostered when students engage in practice that:
    1.  focuses on a specific goal or criterion for performance,
    1.  targets an appropriate level of challenge relative to students’ current performance, and
    1.  is of sufficient quantity and frequency to meet the performance criteria.
1.  Articulate goals in measurable ways:
    1.  Use good metrics that relate to the objective and to possible performance from the learner.
    1.  Include higher-level goals.
1.  Concurrent learning can work, but often not at the novice skill level.
1.  While quality of practice matters, time on task is also important.
1.  Practice tends to be most effective at improving skills in the "competent" range.
    (Novices grapple with known knowns, competent practitioners with known unknowns, and experts with unknown unknowns.)
1.  Instructors should point out progress as it is made
    so that students recognize their accomplishment and discern the change in their behavior,
    especially when gradual.
1.  Grades and scores provide some information on the degree to which students' performance has met the criteria,
    they do not explain which aspects did or did not meet the criteria and how,
    so more specific feedback is necessary.

###How Learning Works, Chapter 1. 

###How does students’ prior knowledge affect their learning?


1. Learners come with past experiences and models of knowledge. If we can activate that prior knowledge and correctly link it to what we are trying to teach, the effect will be increased retention and a greater ability to apply what we are teaching to novel problems.
2.  If the learner's past knowledge is not activated, we lose this integration of knowledge and amplifying effect of their past experience, declarative and procedural knowledge.
3. If the learner comes with incorrect information or misunderstands how the new knowledge relates to their past experience, their learning can be hindered until they understand the misconception.
4. The nature of misconceptions is that the learner will not realise they have them. Specifically, if asked they may well report that they understand the situation. 
5. Testing knowledge (diagnostic assessment), with well designed multiple choice questions for example, will reveal the misconceptions and form a basis for correcting them.
6. Well crafted challenges will provide the learner with information about their understanding. Faded examples support the student and provide a “win” at the start and indicate a lack when they stop being able to complete the challenge.
7. Successfully completing a challenge while still holding a misconception is a very, very bad thing……
8. Using examples that involve universal activities rather than domain specific or highly technical examples will maximise the number of correct connections that form the basis of transferring knowledge. It is a delicate balance because if it is too trivial or simple, students may dismiss it as not important or that they already understand the information and switch off to conserve energy. Engagement/entertaining examples, maybe with some humour or an interesting story will allow you to keep engagement while speaking directly to most people’s experiences. 
9. Analogies are useful in connecting past understanding to a current problem but be explicit about how it applies to the situation because the learner may not understand where the analogy breaks down or stops being applicable.
10. Point number 10 is a hidden point, it can be found by carefully reading the book! :-)
