## Top Ten

### What Kinds of Practice and Feedback Enhance Learning?

1.  Mismatched expectations can be difficult to diagnose and waste much time.
1.  In the absence of structure, learners tend to glide along more comfortable paths
    (i.e., making slides prettier rather than more content-rich).
1.  Deliberate practice without effective feedback can instill new unknown bad habits.
1.  Learning and performance are best fostered when students engage in practice that:
    1.  focuses on a specific goal or criterion for performance,
    1.  targets an appropriate level of challenge relative to studentsâ€™ current performance, and
    1.  is of sufficient quantity and frequency to meet the performance criteria.
1.  Articulate goals in measurable ways:
    1.  Use good metrics that relate to the objective and to possible performance from the learner.
    1.  Include higher-level goals.
1.  Concurrent learning can work, but often not at the novice skill level.
1.  While quality of practice matters, time on task is also important.
1.  Practice tends to be most effective at improving skills in the "competent" range.
    (Novices grapple with known knowns, competent practitioners with known unknowns, and experts with unknown unknowns.)
1.  Instructors should point out progress as it is made
    so that students recognize their accomplishment and discern the change in their behavior,
    especially when gradual.
1.  Grades and scores provide some information on the degree to which students' performance has met the criteria,
    they do not explain which aspects did or did not meet the criteria and how,
    so more specific feedback is necessary.

### How Does Students' Prior Knowledge Affect Their Learning?

1.  Learners come with past experiences and models of knowledge.
    If we can activate that prior knowledge and correctly link it to what we are trying to teach,
    the effect will be increased retention and a greater ability to apply what we are teaching to novel problems.
1.  If the learner's past knowledge is not activated,
    we lose this integration of knowledge
    and the amplifying effect of their past experience and their declarative and procedural knowledge.
1.  If the learner comes with incorrect information or misunderstands how the new knowledge relates to their past experience,
    their learning can be hindered until they understand the misconception.
1.  The nature of misconceptions is that the learner will not realise they have them.
    Specifically, if asked they may well report that they understand the situation. 
1.  Testing knowledge (e.g., doing diagnostic assessment with well-designed multiple choice questions)
    will reveal the misconceptions and form a basis for correcting them.
1.  Well-crafted challenges will provide the learner with information about their understanding.
    Faded examples support the student and provide a "win" at the start
    and indicate a lack when they stop being able to complete the challenge.
1.  Successfully completing a challenge while still holding a misconception about the subject of the challenge is a very bad thing,
    because it increases the learners' confidence in their incorrect model.
1.  Using examples that involve universal activities rather than domain specific or highly technical examples
    will maximise the number of correct connections that form the basis of transferring knowledge.
    It is a delicate balance:
    if the problem is too simple,
    students may dismiss it as unimportant
    or and switch off to conserve energy because they believe they already understand.
    Some humour or an interesting story will allow you to keep engagement
    while speaking directly to most people's experiences. 
1.  Analogies are useful in connecting past understanding to a current problem,
    but be explicit about how it applies to the situation
    because the learner may not understand where the analogy breaks down or stops being applicable.

### Why Do Student Development and Course Climate Matter for Student Learning?

1.  Make uncertainty safe - support students who are uncomfortable with ambiguity (i.e. there are various solutions to an answer).
1.  Resist a single right answer - acknowledge that we are teaching them one way to do things, but there are many many tools that could be used to do the same thing (version control, visualisation, etc).
1.  Examine your assumptions about students - don't expect people to be able (or unable) to do a specific task based on their race, gender, age, experience). 
1.  Reduce anonymity - try to remember names (or encourage learners to wear their badges), provide opportunity for learners to interact during breaks, and as instructor, remember to interact as well, rather than reading emails during break and looking aloof)
1.  Establish and reinforce ground rules for interaction - refer to the code of conduct and have a plan of action for when the code of conduct is breached. 
1.  Use the syllabus and first day of class to establish the course climate - sticking to the published agenda and course timings is one of the things that we get the most consistent positive comment about. Tell learners what they can expect and keep to what you told them. If things have to change, inform them properly. Once people start to feel like they don't know what is going on in terms of what they can expect, it's very hard for them to focus on learning new skills.
1.  Set up processes to get feedback on the climate - collect sticky notes before lunch and before the end of day for 2-day workshops and develop another strategy for workshops that run over multiple half days or other formats. Go through the feedback immediately and act upon the suggestions that can be dealt with immediately. A responsive instructor gain the trust of learners and make them feel important and heard.
1. Model inclusive language, behaviour, and attitudes - as instructor, try to address all learners equally rather than only talking to the ones who follow along nicely or demands more of your attention.
1. Be mindful of low-ability cues - the HLW example:"I'll be happy to help you with this because I know girls have trouble with math." Think about how you address your students and what stereotypes you are reinforcing unintentionally with jokes for example.
1. Adress tensions early - sometimes workshops have one or two very experienced computational people in the room filled otherwise with novices. Try to think of ways to keep them engaged by maybe asking them to rather act as helpers than learners - they might not like it if they have paid to attend a course where they hoped to learn something new, so find ways to acknowledge their help as well.
