## Misconceptions

three levels
- simple factual knowledge (Vancouver is the capital of BC)
- broken models ("force and motion must be in the same direction"): address by confronting with contradiction
- fundamental beliefs (the climate isn't changing)

people are good at compartmentalizing knowledge
- "what do I think, or what's going to get me the grade?"

## Activating Prior Knowledge

problem: cards have A, 6, M, 7, rule is "if there's a vowel on one side, there must be an even number on the other"
Q: smallest set of cards to turn over to check that this is true?
A: A & 7, but hard

problem: 16, Coke, beer, 23, rule is "must be over 21 to drink alcohol"
- isomorphic, but higher success rate
- more tangible and more familiar

*transference* requires *activation*

peer instruction gives two opportunities to activate prior knowledge (initial thinking & during discussion)

example: relate what we're doing with shell or Python to what they did with GUI or spreadsheet

Schwartz & Bransford (1998) demo then explanation creates "a time for telling"
- generating student interest

problem with computing: we don't have physical experience to activate
- nothing equivalent to "throw a ball in the air and then it drops"

good problem: iron block on block of ice in bathtub

## Big Picture in Genetics

concept mapping exercise: give the learners the concepts on sticky notes, have them draw the connections on a whiteboard

- low-performing students tend to use absolutes on connections ("A _therefore_ B")
- high-performing tend to use nuanced connections ("A _can sometimes_ B")

## Building Adaptive Expertise

graph axes are efficiency and innovation (Bransford et al 2000)
novice is low in both
"routine expert" is high efficiency, low innovation (maybe "competent practitioner"?)
"adaptive expert" is high both
- routine: know the solution strategy, "just" need to apply it
- adaptive: need to figure out the solution strategy
- routine doesn't tend to work in real world (context lacking)
- Q: can someone be low efficiency but high innovation? (good Q for instructor training course)

- distinguish between exercises and problems
  - exercise is application of bounded solution strategy
  - problem requires meta thinking
  - open-ended questions needed to develop skill with the latter
  - want questions that permit multiple solution strategies

## Role of Knowledge Organization

- complete newcomer: a few nodes, very few connections, things aren't all joined up (disjoint sub-graphs)
- others may have a sequential organization of "knowledge" (just one workflow - if they get stuck, they're stuck)
- hierarchical is good, but dense graph is better

- hierarchical study aids recall: chunking

deep patterns
- novices recognize superficial features ("this is an inclined plane problem")
- experts recognize deep structure/solution method ("this is a conservation of energy problem")

- knowledge organization formed by novices may not be helpful (since it's unguided)
- we need to guide their organization, as well as giving them things to organizing
  - i.e., give one level of meta

- Warren Code's number-to-shape example
  - without organizing principle, have to memorize
  - with organizing principle, remember one *pattern* and everything else makes sense
- Mendelian genetics ratios
  - if you understand meiosis and probability, the numbers are "obvious"

- find reference to Ashley Cetnar's work
- # of connections in concept map to key concepts correlated well with performance on tests

- give them the diagram *beforehand*: http://www.futurity.org/diagrams-learning-939352/

- Willingham: principles are useless and unlearnable without facts to connect and push around
  - not just a matter of examples: principles are connections, and you can't connect things if you don't have things

- mention Scanlan 1989 when talking about concept maps and other graphical representations of knowledge
- also mention disabilities

  - you shouldn't have to stop learning to play the game, or stop playing the game to learn
  - similarly, you shouldn't have to stop doing science to code, or stop coding to do science

*   bridge
    *   we don't (yet) do summative in SWC/DC
    *   but we need formative's feedback to control pace
    *   and we can use both to design lessons
*   understanding by design
    1.  goals: what do we want people to understand?
    2.  design the summative assessment: how will learners demonstrate learning?
    3.  design the formative assessments: how will they practice *and* how will instructors tell if they're making progress?
    4.  close the gap between what they know and what they need to know for each formative assessment
    *   comment: having a shared method is more important than what the method is...
*   "But isn't this teaching to the test?"
    *   James Scott's "Seeing Like a State": large organizations prefer uniformity to productivity
        *   Centralization isn't always bad: cf. segregation in the South
    *   Who has the power and how is it used?
        *   Teachers using it to design lessons *or* central organization using it to rate teachers?
	*   Are teachers just being measured, or helped to improve?  We'll return to this later...
