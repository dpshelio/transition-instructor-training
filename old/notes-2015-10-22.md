**Feedback Homework 1 (Steve)**

* questions you got on previous iterations of the courses are good sources of misconceptions
* accumulating common misconceptions helps create better material and lessons 
* There were some people reaching the "1 answer, 2 comments" line. How can we get more people to get there?
* split up people into groups, "feedback circles"
* Problem: with 120 homework answers visible, it's overwhelming, and easiest to just pick randomly.
  * Solution idea: make it easier somehow to view or sort answers, to find those that need more comments?
* Problem: if the goal we have in mind while scrolling through is just "give feedback", it's hard to know how to engage with posts that are on content we don't know, and easier to just skip them.
  * Solution idea: Make it easier to find (in the pinned question post, for example) information about *what sort of feedback* we're supposed to be giving, so we have specific modes of engagement in mind that are easier to apply to an arbitrary question 

**Note on misconceptions**
* best to try and probe the deeper misunderstandings - the broken mental model - rather than the factual aspects e.g. that London is the capital of the UK
* some people were quite ambitious and tried to test several things in one MCQ, may not always be sucessfull with that 

**Feedback at the begining of a class (what we just did now)**
* on longer running classes it might make sense to collect feedback on teaching approach
* allows you to adapt your teaching methods/content to student feedback
* give students a sense of self-efficacy --- allow students to shape thier own learning experience

**What did you learn from the MCQ?**
* Hard to find those MCQs that test concepts
* Difficult to construct one
* MCQs need to be specific to avoid alternative, while still correct interpretations
* Isolating to just one concept was hard
* it's easier to come up with questions about misconception-testing MCQs in the 2nd or 3rd iteration
* Easier to create questions w/ good distractors after experience teaching the material + encountering real misconceptions

**PCK - pedagogical content knowledge**
* Not an existing inventory for teaching computing

**Example from Physics: FCI (Force concept inventory) for Newtonian mechanics**
* ask questions -> interview -> look for correlation between wrong answers + misconceptions -> (iterate)
* potential: find correlations in answers to predict misconceptions (but long, iterative process)
* problem: questions and answers can now be found on the internet -> students might memorize answers to "pass" the test (flaw of educational system)
* very expensive and with high risk of the effort being hampered because of the the way people see assessments and internet

**Connectivity**
* We explained the difference between novice and competent: what's the difference between competent and expert?
  * Not necessarily more facts
* Experts have more densely connected knowledge graphs
  * Enough connections to jump to the conclusion/solution without reasoning it, Unconscious competence 
  * Denser graph, the more connections between the facts, the more likely the fact to stay in the brian.
  * Note: this statement is a lie
    * People don't actually represent knowledge as graphs
    * But it's a useful metaphor 
  * Experts can leap directly from problem to solution because they have a direct link ("intuition")
  * When they are asked to explain, they fabricate a path of intermediate steps that they didn't actually take. They did not need the intermediate steps themselves.
  * Expertise (intitution) is powerful, but can be really frustrating to non-experts!  
  * expert didn't see the steps.
* This explains expert blind spot
  * Experts are often less good at teaching than competent practitioners because they don't actually reason to the solution
  * Experts make up their reasoning when asked, not the path they would take now. No longer conciously reasoning anymore. Unconscious competence 
  * Experts often not brilliant teachers, because of this. 

**How experts can better teach to novice/competent learners**
* The J-Rule in SWC tries to prevent unhelpful explanations
  * "The J-word damages credibility" - [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/former-google-exec-says-this-word-can-damage-your-credibility-2015-6)
  * just is the passive dismissive adjective, similar to 'obvious'
  * It takes effort to learn to see things through a beginner's eyes - but it is a skill, that can be practiced and learned
* Also explains fluid representations
  * Experts can shift approaches (e.g., geometrical to algebraic) quickly and appropriately
  * Competent practitioners usually only have one solution
* Also explains why experts are better at diagnosis
  * Denser graph makes it easier to reason backward from symptoms to causes
  * debugging a better test of expertise than "creation" of a program
* Helping learners make connections is as important as introducing facts
  * Try to connect to things they already know, helps learning
  * Analogy with social networks: the more connections a fact has, the more likely it is to stay connected

**Short-term (working) memory constraints**
* Q: what's the most important number in teaching?
* A: 7 +/- 2
* Explanation:
  * As a gross simplification, we have two memory systems
  * Long-term or persistent memory is unbounded (we die before it fills up) but slow (hundreds of milliseconds to recall)
  * Short-term or working memory is faster (milliseconds or less) but smaller (7 +/- 2 — more likely 4-5 items)
    * Backed up by many psychological studies
    * Folk evidence: phone numbers, size of sports teams (larger teams break down into groups), etc.
    * you can also see this in sport teams, meetings or workgroups decomposing when the group gets larger
      * Group size of 6-7 people will stay together. Larger ones break into subgroups.
* Implication: we cannot simply shovel facts into heads
  * Learning requires us to load up short-term and reinforce so that it's transferred to long-term
    * That's what we mean by "learning"
    * break up content into chunks (the teaching blocks referred to last week)
    * Lecture/talk for a little bit and then give hands-on activities for 5-10 minutes to reinforce the learning 
  * We need a way to measure what we're trying to put into short-term memory

**Concept Maps**
* Concept map: a picture of someone's mental graph
  * Facts are bubbles, connections are labelled arcs
    * May or may not be directional
    * Labelled because saying "X is related to Y" without saying how is just annoying
    * And yes, one person's fact is another person's connection, but that's a good starting point for discussion
* An example of externalized cognition
  * Flowcharts, decision trees, and blueprints can be even more useful in some contexts
  * But resist the urge to draw knowledge as if it was hierarchical, because it isn't
* Example: for loop in Python
  * Statement: http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/img/02/for-loop-statement.png
  * Concepts: http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/img/02/for-loop-concepts.png
    * In this case, connect concepts to concrete elements of the code
    * Don't/can't always do this
  * Relationships: http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/img/02/for-loop-arcs.png
    * 3 + 3 = 6 things so far
    * Redundancy is not a problem when teaching, rather, it may help students to build thier own densely connected graph
  * Recommendations: http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/img/02/for-loop-rec.png
    * Highlights the difference between a concept map and a syntax diagram: usage
    * Remember, we are helping novices build an initial mental model
      * decide on what you want to go in that basic model and teach that and not other stuff
    * Growing the model is more helpful than just presenting it as a finished product (thus blackboard is better than slides)
    * "Mental Model" of the for-loop in Python
* Examples from previous rounds of instructor training:    
  * Array math in Python http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/img/02/array-math.png
  * Conditional statements http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/img/02/conditionals.png
  * Creating and destroying files in the shell http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/img/02/create-destroy.png
  * Sets and dictionaries http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/img/02/dict-set.png
  * Input and output http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/img/02/io.png
  * List comprehensions in Python http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/img/02/list-comp.png
  * Lists and loops http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/img/02/lists-loops.png
  * File permissions in Unix http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/img/02/perms.png
  * The tr command http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/img/02/tr-cmd.png
  * Some of these are bigger than they should be
    * More importantly, they should all be hand-drawn
    * Rule of UI design: the less apparent effort went into something, the more honest the feedback

How to use Concept Maps
* "The rougher something is, the more probable it is to get honest feedback"
  * rule by e.g. UI designers
  * homework will be hand-drawn for that reason
* Uses of concept maps
  * To aid solo design of a lesson: what am I thinking?
    * Separates content from order: rarely teach in the order in which the map was first drawn
  * To communicate with fellow lesson designers
    * Instructors with very different mental models are likely to pull in different directions when teaching
    * draw the map as you are talking.
  * To communicate with learners
    * Hand out the map beforehand for them to annotate
    * Better: draw it piece by piece while teaching to reinforce synchronization between elements and what's taught
      * Correlating visual and linguistic input improves recall
  * Formative assessment: getting learners to draw concept maps of what they just heard shows you what they didn't
    * Too time-consuming for use in workshops
    * But useful in weekly lectures
    * Once learners are familiar with the technique
    * Can speed it up by giving the learners the concepts on sticky notes and have them draw the connections on a whiteboard (scaffolding)
  * But remember Glass's Law: any new tool or technique initially slows you down
  * Neat trick
    * Get everyone in a lab or project team to draw a concept map of what they're working on independently
    * Then compare - leads to lots of discussion
* Observations about concept maps    
  * Complete newcomer: a few nodes, very few connections, things aren't all joined up (disjoint sub-graphs)
  * Others may have a sequential organization of knowledge
    * Just one path through it
    * If any step in their reasoning fails, they're stuck
  * Low-performing students tend to use absolutes on connections ("A therefore B")
  * High-performing tend to use nuanced connections ("A can sometimes B")
* Formalizing concept maps "takes the life out"
  * Example: No one uses UML diagrams, but a "mish mash"

**Cognitive Load**
* A useful psychological basis for instructional design is *cognitive load theory*
  * Sometimes criticized on philosophical grounds as unfalsifiable
  * But instruction based on it has been proven effective
  * And it's a good framework for tying together several other ideas about learning
* People's brains deal with three kinds of load when they're learning:
  * Intrinsic load is what they have to keep in mind in order to carry out a learning task
  * Germane load is the (desirable) mental effort required to create linkages between new information and old
    * Which is one of the things that distinguishes learning from memorization
  * Extraneous load is everything else that distracts or gets in the way
    * I.e. translating between notations or languages while learning, it is a distraction for learning.
* Eliminating extraneous cognitive load accelerates learning
* Hard part is to figure out what's extraneous    
  * Which is why the theory is criticized as unfalsifiable
  * But research over the last three decades has identified a few factors
* Example: work by Richard Mayer et al on split-attention effect    
  * Correlating linguistic, auditory, and visual streams of information takes cognitive effort
    * Brain can't help but check that it's getting the same information from all channels
  * Learning is therefore more effective when redundant information is not being presented simultaneously in two different channels
  * Audio narration with on-screen captions is harder to learn from than either on its own(assuming no hearing impairment or cognitive dysfunction)
  * Speech and images is more effective without captions for native speakers of the language
  * But (possibly) more effective for non-native speakers (for whom redundancy improves capture)
* Searching for a solution strategy is a cognitive load in its own right
  * Can be reduced by giving learners worked examples that show them a problem and a detailed step-by-step solution
  * To maximize impact, worked examples should immediately be followed by a series of faded examples
    * Present learners with a problem and a solution in which some parts are left blank to be filled in
    * Each successive problem has more initial blanks
* Faded examples are less intimidating than a blank screen
  * Learners are less likely to feel that they don't even know where to start
  * Also encourage learners to think about the similarities and differences between various approaches
    * Which helps shape the conceptual categories we want them to form
* Step 1: explain this:

~~~
def total_length(words):
    '''Calculate total length of all words.'''
    total = 0
    for word in words:
        total += len(word)
    return total
~~~

* then ask learners to fill in the blanks in:

~~~
def word_lengths(words):
    '''Return list of lengths of all words.'''
    lengths = ____
    for word in words:
        lengths ____
    return lengths
~~~

* Step 2: explain this:

~~~
doubles = [2 * x for x in items]
~~~

* then ask learners to get a list of lengths:

~~~
lengths = [____ for ____ in words]
~~~

* Step 3: combine ideas with:

~~~
def word_lengths(____):
    return ____
~~~

* Parsons Problem:
  * Words are given, but jumbled. need to be rearranged to make sense. 
  * This is a good intermediate step. Separate vocabulary from grammar.
  * Programming: lines are jumbled. Code is written, but lines are jumbled. 
  * https://github.com/js-parsons/js-parsons
  * good technique for a wide variety of learner skill level
* creating exercises, that demonstrate concepts in a step by step manners is hard, but more helpful
