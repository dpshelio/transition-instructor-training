I wanted to follow up on last night's instructor training discussion session - my understanding is that you didn't have questions, and didn't play an active part in the discussion. These sessions are a key part of bringing new instructors into the community, and we wish to see you be involved in the conversation as part of your checkout procedure for instructor training. If you experienced any difficulties participating, please let us know so we can explore ways to be of more support. This could include the language the sessions are conducted in, the platform hosting the video calls, or other considerations.  Otherwise, I would be grateful if you could participate in another discussion session some time in the next few weeks - if you don't have questions about our lessons or workshop operations, you can always bring thoughts or comments on other teaching or training you've done, and how it compares with our approaches.
