I wanted to follow up on last night's instructor training discussion
session - my understanding is that you didn't have questions, and
didn't play an active part in the discussion.  These sessions are a
key part of bringing new instructors into the community, so I would be
grateful if you could do another one some time in the next few weeks -
if you don't have questions about our lessons or workshop operations,
you can always bring thoughts or comments on other teaching or
training you've done, and how it compares with our approaches.
