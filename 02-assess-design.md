*   define *summative assessment*
    *   socially necessary because we have to batch people (driver's license)
*   contrast with *formative assessment*
    *   school system trains people to treat formative as summative (every test is a test)
*   bridge
    *   we don't (yet) do summative in SWC/DC
    *   but we need formative's feedback to control pace
    *   and we can use both to design lessons
*   reverse instructional design (understanding by design)
    1.  design the summative assessment: how will learners demonstrate learning?
    2.  design the formative assessments: how will they practice *and* how will instructors tell if they're making progress?
    3.  close the gap between what they know and what they need to know for each formative assessment
    *   comment: having a shared method is more important than what the method is...
*   example of formative assessment: 27 + 15
    *   plausible distractors with diagnostic power
    *   requires the instructor to model the learner's mental models
    *   give good and bad examples (e.g., "just typos" is a bad MCQ)
*   "But isn't this teaching to the test?"
    *   Who has the power?
