## Reverse Instructional Design

*   *Test-driven development* (TDD) in software development
    *   Conventional approach is:
        1.  Decide what to build
        2.  Build it
        3.  Do some testing (optional)
    *   TDD:
        1.  Decide what to build
        2.  Write some tests that fail now but will pass when the feature is added or the bug is fixed
        3.  Write just enough software to make those tests pass
        4.  Clean up
        *   Sometimes called "red-green-refactor"
    *   Works because:
        *   Defining requirements as tests helps us clarify our thinking (externalize cognition)
        *   Having goalposts reduces risk of endless polishing
            *   Most of us would rather program for a week than test for an hour
        *   Writing tests *before* writing software reduces risk of confirmation bias
            *   We never test our own software as fairly as someone else does
*   Wiggins & McTighe: *Understanding by Design*
    *   Three-step process analogous to TDD:
        1.  Identify what is worth learning
            *   E.g., draw concept maps
        2.  Decide what constitutes evidence that learning has taken place
            *   E.g., create the summative assessment (final exam)
        3.  Plan instruction to close the gap between what learners know and what they need to know and prepare learners to demonstrate what they have learned
            *   E.g., create formative assessments (in class) and exercises (out of class)
            *   *Then* write the lessons
*   Parnas & Clements: "A Rational Design Process: How and Why to Fake It" (1986)
    *   People rarely follow the steps exactly as laid out
        *   The term "waterfall" was coined to describe what software development *don't* do
    *   But we want it to *look* like a repeatable sequential process afterward because that's what's easiest to understand
*   RID is *not* "teaching to the test"
    *   RID: teachers set goals to aid in lesson design
        *   Might never actually give the final exam that was designed as a goal
    *   T2T: external authority defines assessment criteria that affect outcomes for teachers
        *   Creates perverse incentives
    *   *Building a Better Teacher*: focus on measurement with little (usually no) help for improving
        *   *Seeing Like a State*: large organizations invariably prefer uniformity to productivity

## What Is Learning?

*   What kind(s) of learning are we aiming for?
    *   Want a taxonomy that is hierarchical, measurable, stable, and cross-cultural
    *   But you can't always get what you want...
*   [Bloom's taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy) (1956) is the most widely known
*   Wiggins & McTighe's *facets of understanding* and Fink's taxonomy (from *Creating Significant Learning Experiences*) are more recent

## Who Are Our Learners?

*   Learning modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic): widely known, but pseudoscience
    *   No evidence that matching teaching method to preferred learning modality changes outcomes
* Honey and Mumford: characterize the learning cycle and where people prefer to enter it
    1.  *Doing* something or having an experience
    2.  *Reflecting* on the experience
    3.  *Concluding* from the experience, developing a theory
    4.  *Planning* the next steps to apply or test the theory
*   Leads to four categories of learners
    *   Also frequently criticized
    *   But a more useful vocabulary for describing who we meet in class
