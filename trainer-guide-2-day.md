subtitle: 2-day face-to-face Instructor Training guide for Trainers
---

This is a detailed trainer's guide for running a two-day intense face-to-face Instructor Training workshop. The guide should allow the trainers plan and deliver the workshop but it is not a strict schedule. The trainers should allow for some flexibility and adapting to the local circumstances.

## Theming exercises Day 1
On the first day of the training you will ask the trainee instructors to complete a series of exercises. Theming these exercises (so providing some guidelines on the topics) helps trainees be more focused and complete the exercises on time. It will also provide a nice thread throughout the day.

The idea for Day 1 is to build exercises around "the coolest thing in your research / work".

* Multiple Choice Question: design an MCQ about the coolest thing in your research/work OR choose a topic that would be introduced in the first undergrad year in your domain (possibly try to design a question which can be assessed by your partner at the IT). If you absolutely cannot come up with such question, then pick a topic from the SWC/DC curriculum.
* Concept map: 
* First recorded teaching (video) exercise: 


## Proposed schedule

A typical schedule for a two-day course is:

*   Day 1

        *Show one of the SciPy workshop videos.<br/> 
        Provide feedback on it using the 2x2 grid. Trainer puts in a couple of comments demonstrating difference between contents and delivery. <br/>*
    *   **11:30 EXERCISE 2 Recorded teaching** <br/>
        *In groups of 3. <br/>
        Introduce yourself and talk about the coolest thing in your research/work. <br/>
        2 minutes<br/>
