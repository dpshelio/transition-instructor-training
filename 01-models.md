## Cognitive Development and Mental Models

> It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble.
> It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.  
> - Mark Twain

*   mental models
    *   ball and spring model of molecules
    *   computer memory is a lot more complex than my usual mental model
*   novice-competent-expert (Patricia Benner)
    *   defer discussion of expertise to next lesson
    *   our goal is to help novices build workable mental model
    *   too many facts too early is counter-productive: reinforces incorrect mental model (weight in boxes analogy)
    *   we have to clear up misconceptions
*   misconceptions guide lesson
    *   simple *factual knowledge* (Vancouver is the capital of BC)
    *   *broken models* ("force and motion must be in the same direction")
        *   address by confronting contradiction
    *   *fundamental beliefs* (the climate isn't changing)
    *   We focus on the middle layer when teaching novices.

## Assessment

*   instructors need insight into learners' mental models to know what to fix and how quickly to proceed
    *   *formative assessment*: happens during learning to guide teacher and learner
    *   contrast with *summative assessment*: happens at the end to check that learning occurred
        *   socially necessary because we have to batch people (driver's license)
    *   problem: school trains people to treat formative as summative (every test is a test)
*   example of formative assessment: 27 + 15
    *   plausible distractors with diagnostic power
    *   choosing distractors requires the instructor to model the learner's mental models
    *   if there aren't diagnostic distractors, use a different MCQ
