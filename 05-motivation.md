## Motivation

*   People learn best when:
    *   they care about the topic
    *   they believe they can master it
*   Which can be a problem
    *   Most scientists don't want to program: they want to do science
    *   Early experiences with programming are often demoralizing
    *   Believing that something will be hard to learn is a self-fulfilling prophecy
*   Teach the most immediately useful topics first
    *   Where "time to usefulness" includes actual setup times
*   Example: media-first computation

## Strategies

*   Strategies to establish value
    1.  Connect the material to students' interests
    2.  Provide authentic, real-world tasks
    3.  Show relevance to students' current academic lives
    4.  Demonstrate the relevance of higher-level skills to students' future professional lives
    5.  Identify and reward what you value
    6.  Show your own passion and enthusiasm for the discipline
*   Strategies to build positive expectations
    1.  Ensure alignment of objectives, assessments, and instructional strategies
    2.  Identify an appropriate level of challenge
    3.  Create assignments that provide the appropriate level of challenge
    4.  Provide early success opportunities
    5.  Articulate your expectations
    6.  Provide rubrics
    7.  Provide targeted feedback
    8.  Be fair
    9.  Educate students about the ways we explain success and failure
    10. Describe effective study strategies
*   Strategies for self-efficacy
    1.  Provide flexibility and control
    2.  Give students an opportunity to reflect

## Demotivation

*   Not demotivating learners is at least as important as motivating them
*   Biggest demotivators are *indifference* and *unfairness*
*   Biggest question is, what do you do after something's gone wrong?

> ## Authentic Tasks
>
> Describe something you do in your daily work that uses one or more of the skills we teach,
> and explain how you would use it (or a simplified version of it) as an exercise or example in class.
{: .challenge}

> ## Tests as Rubrics
>
> Create a simple exercise you would have learners do in class,
> and then create half a dozen test cases they could use to check their work as they're doing it.

> ## Personal Story About Demotivation
>
> Write a paragraph or two about something that happened in your educational career
> that demotivated you, and explain what could have been done afterward to fix it.
