## Motivation

*   People learn best when:
    *   they care about the topic
    *   they believe they can master it
*   Which can be a problem
    *   Most scientists don't want to program: they want to do science
    *   Early experiences with programming are often demoralizing
    *   Believing that something will be hard to learn is a self-fulfilling prophecy
*   Teach the most immediately useful topics first
    *   Where "time to usefulness" includes actual setup times
*   Example: media-first computation

## Strategies for Motivating Learners

*   Strategies to establish value
    1.  Connect the material to students' interests
    2.  Provide authentic, real-world tasks
    3.  Show relevance to students' current academic lives
    4.  Demonstrate the relevance of higher-level skills to students' future professional lives
    5.  Identify and reward what you value
    6.  Show your own passion and enthusiasm for the discipline
*   Strategies to build positive expectations
    1.  Ensure alignment of objectives, assessments, and instructional strategies
    2.  Identify an appropriate level of challenge
    3.  Create assignments that provide the appropriate level of challenge
    4.  Provide early success opportunities
    5.  Articulate your expectations
    6.  Provide rubrics
    7.  Provide targeted feedback
    8.  Be fair
    9.  Educate students about the ways we explain success and failure
    10. Describe effective study strategies
*   Strategies for self-efficacy
    1.  Provide flexibility and control
    2.  Give students an opportunity to reflect
*   What's missing: strategies to motivate the *instructor*

## Demotivation

*   Not demotivating learners is at least as important as motivating them
*   Biggest demotivators are *indifference* and *unfairness*
    *   Biggest *question* is, what do you do after something's gone wrong?
*   Example: stereotype threat
    *   Explain what it is

## How to Be a Good Ally

*   Listen.
    When people talk about their lives and experiences, take them seriously. They are the experts.
*   Do your homework; don't expect others to educate you.
    Some people may be happy to do this, but you are not entitled to it.
    Many, many people have written on diversity issues---it's not hard to find information.
*   Call out discrimination, bias, and unfairness when you see it,
    whether it is intentional or not (but also be wary of monopolizing conversations).
*   Support victims of harassment by believing them,
    and do not blame them or try to minimize their experiences by telling them to 'just ignore' their harassers.
*   Elevate the voices of members of marginalized groups.
*   Be conscious of your own language and actions and the ways they might reinforce systems of oppression and privilege.
*   Don't center your own feelings.
    If you get called out or feel wounded by someone else's tone, go back to point #1.
*   Remember that "ally" isn't a static identity, nor is it a label you get to claim for yourself.
    Allyship is a process, and you're not an ally just because you say you are.
    Do the hard work of being an ally, and don't expect to be thanked or acknowledged every time (or even most of the time).
